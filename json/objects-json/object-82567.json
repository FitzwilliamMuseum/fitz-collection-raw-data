Nevertheless, / there are portions of it which were evidently written / with this view - and, as I have no particular article / for MISCELLANEOUS subjects, you must e'en receive / this in its present place. Indeed it is so lovely, and I / had almost said so matchless, a volume, that you ought / to rejoice to have an account of it in any shape. On / the score of delicate, fresh, carefully-executed art, / this folio may challenge comparison with any simi- / lar treasure in the Biblioth√®que du Roi. The sub- / jects are not crowded, nor minute; nor of a very / wonderful and intricate nature; but they are quietly / composed, softly executed, and are, at this present mo- / ment, in a state of preservation perfectly beautiful and / 2"]
