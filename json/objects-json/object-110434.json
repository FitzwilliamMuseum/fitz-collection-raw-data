From the siren holding her tails spring spiral, floral scrolls of roses and tulips, which shelter a long bodied bird.  Upon each scroll sits an imp with a leaf sprig in its hand.    At each side of the base of the vase there are floral prays with a hare and Dachshund motif.  Sprays sprout from the back of the eagles.
