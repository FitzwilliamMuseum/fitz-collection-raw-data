Portrait of Thomas Hobson, half-length, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, ruff, and cloak, and reaching into a drawstring pouch held at his waist with his right hand. A wall or post at the far left and archway behind and to the right, are delineated by darker areas of cross-hatching. Title and production details within the image at upper left and right: 'Mr Hobson; obyt ano 1630 / vixit annos 86'. A verse engraved below: 'Laugh not to see so plaine a Man in print, / The shadow's homely, yet ther's something in't, / Witnes the Bagg he wear's though seeming poore / The fertile Mother of a thousand more: / He was a thrueing [thriving] Man, through lawfull Gaine, / And wealthy grew by warrantable paine; / Then laugh at them that spend, not them yt gather, / Like thriueing [thriving] Sonnes of such a thrifty Father.'. Below the verse at lower left: 'Cum privileg: Are to be soud [sold?] by P. Stent [excised words] I Payne fecit'. This is the third state of the engraving, as documented by Globe, no. 176, p. 71. An inscription in graphite at lower right: 'N.15'. Watermark: fleur-de-lis."]
