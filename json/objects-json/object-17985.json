Each formed of an elbow-length, slightly flared, tubular cuff, three downward-overlapping wrist-plates, five upward-overlapping metacarpal-plates, a knuckle-plate, four scaled finger-defences, and a hinged, scaled thumb-defence.  The cuff, which is strongly shaped to the point of the elbow, is formed of a medially-ridged outer plate and a considerably shorter inner plate.  The latter is riveted within the former.  The upper edge of the cuff has a plain inward turn accompanied by a recessed border.  The knuckle-plate and the lower edge of the fifth metacarpal-plate are each shaped to the knuckles.  The cuff, the wrist-plates, the metacarpal-plates and the knuckle-plate are connected to one another by rivets at their outer ends.  The finger defences are each formed of between four and five medially-ridged, upward-overlapping scales, of which the last has a rounded end and is incised with a line representing the base of a fingernail.  Attached by broad leather hinge to the front end of the metacarpal-plates and the third wrist-plate is a scaled thumb-defence of nine upward-overlapping scales.\nThe thumb-defence is of lozenge-shape, reaching its widest point at the top of its sixth lame, but otherwise matches the finger-scales.  The outer plate of the cuff is decorated medially with a band of incised chevrons enclosed by a pair of incised lines, and in its upper band with a series of diagonal incised lines.  The secondary edges of the gauntlet are bordered by pairs of incised lines.  The gauntlets retain their original buff-leather lining-gloves, and are fitted at the lower ends of their cuffs with modern straps and buckles that fasten across the insides of the wrist. Part of the composite half armour HEN.M.16A-F-1933."]
