Head and shoulders of a middle-aged man in profile, facing right, wearing a long, curled and powdered wig. Production details etched at upper left: 'APond fecit / 1739'. Title, engraved at lower centre and lower right: 'Tho. Sadler Arm. / NIL CONSCIRE SIBI. / 1739'. Handwritten graphite inscription on the verso: 'George 2nd Reign / Gentry / Antiquary / Etched by A Pond 1739 / Bromley p. 269 vid[e] Walpole Life of A Pond.'. See Notes. An etched portrait of Thomas Sadler (died 1754) by Arthur Pond. Sadler was a civil servant who served in the Treasury as Deputy-Clerk of the Pells under Sir Edward Walpole (1706-1784). He was also an antiquary and amateur artist who 'distinguished himself as a person of taste, made drawings and formed a fine collection of agates, shells etc. which were sold at his death January 3rd, 1754.'. (See Noble, p. 349). He was the son of the artist, Thomas Sadler (fl. 1670–1700) and grandson of the lawyer and political reformer, John Sadler (1615–1674) who was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge and Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge from 1650. The British Museum holds a proof of the portrait before lettering (See: 1870,0514.1983) and an early state with production details added but before the engraving of the title (See: 1977,U.426). P.14792-R is another impression which has been cut to the plate mark."]
