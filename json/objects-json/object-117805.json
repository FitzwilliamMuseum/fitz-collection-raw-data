Sticks of pierced ivory with silver and gold incrustations; guards of carved ivory with silver and gold incrustations, backed with mother-of-pearl and coloured foile (14+2); rivet set with square, table cut, clear pastes.  Front:  Three medallions framed by gold sequins on a pale green ground.  The central scene (with two rows of sequins) has a lady and her son going towards a couple of peasants, and a boy cleaning a gentleman's shoes on the right.  The group is flanked by architecture; in the background there is a mountain landscape with a village and a mansion.  The main scene is flanked by two ovals, one with a woman selling flowers from a tray, the other one showing a man carrying water.  The free spaces are filled with sprays of flowers and exotic birds.  Top and lower edges have a gold border, top edging of gold foile; right and left border has scrolling gold ornaments on a darker background.  Back:  the stitching of the sequins on the front shows on the reverse forming the same medallion.  The flanking ovals are undecorated; the central medallion has a Chinese style branch with red berries.  Sticks:  from the guards to the middle, the sticks are decorated in a symmetrical way: scrolling, fretted ornaments and crosses encircled by a gold line; three sticks form a medallion with flowers and a vase, the first stick is repeated and in the centre four sticks form a big vase surrounded by flowers.  Guards:  Both guards are decorated in a similar way:  on the shoulder a bunch of arrows, a trumpet over a ribbon with a tambourine. (The inside of the back guard is decorated in the same way).  The guard proper is deeply cut and backed with mother-of-pearl and with puce foile at the top left corner.  On the bottom, a music trophy comprising a hat, a mandolin and a trumpet, above a vase with a scrolling ornament in the middle, a flower on top and a pierced flower top left."]
