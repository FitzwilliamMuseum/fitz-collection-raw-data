Frampton who was based at Finsbury Park, north London. The first page is a covering letter addressed to Glaisher at Trinity College, Cambridge: 'Dear Sir, / It is a long time since I have had any valentines & having just secured several I enclose / some on approval. Thanking you for past patronage. / Yours faithfully / R.S. Frampton ...'. The following two pages list the first lines of the verses from a total of 59 valentines, all of which have been identifed in Glaisher's collection, the majority to be found in album P.14416-R. The document also lists the prices for each. Glaisher mentions the arrival of the valentines from Frampton in a letter to his close friend, Catherine Parsons: 'This morning I have recd [received] from Frampton quite a fine lot of valentines, which I have no doubt I shall keep.' Fitzwilliam Museum, MS 935-1985, 27 March 1925, letter to Miss Catherine Parsons. Catherine Parsons undertook to arrange and mount Glaisher's valentine collection into albums from the Autumn of 1924 into the Summer of the following year and beyond and in the course of this process, transcribed Frampton's prices from this list onto the album leaves beside the corresponding valentines."]
