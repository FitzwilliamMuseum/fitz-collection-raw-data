        "value": ["Gauntlet, of mitten form for the right hand, for field use. Formed of a flared cuff, two metacarpal plates, a knuckle-plate and four finger-plates.  The cuff is of tubular form with a rearward-overlapping join at the inside of the wrist secured by two externally-flush rivets.  The inward-turned upper edge of the cuff extends upwards at the outside of the hand in five cusps of which the central one is slightly more prominent than the others. The outside of the cuff is boxed at each side and decorated at its upper end with three ripple-like flutes in the 'gothic' fashion.  The lower edge of the cuff is cut away at the inside of the wrist in a shallow concave curve.  Connected to the lower end of the cuff at its outside are two upward-overlapping metacarpal-plates which are in turn connected by a knuckle-plate to four downward-overlapping finger-plates.  The fourth finger-plate is longer than the rest and has a strongly convex lower end bordered by two 'terraced' flutes.  The metacarpal-plates, the knuckle-plate and the finger-plates are all boxed at their outer ends where they are connected to one another and to the cuff by modern round-headed rivets with octagonal, internal washers.  The ends of the plates are shaped around the rivets.  The lower end of the knuckle-plate, the first three finger-plates and the upper end of the fourth finger-plate are all decorated between the fingers with V-shaped flutes emphasised by single incised lines.  The upper edges of the metacarpal-plates and the knuckle-plate are decorated with small, close-set nicks accompanied by single incised lines, while the lower edges of the knuckle-plate and the first three finger-plates are decorated with close-set nicks alone. Secured within the fourth finger-plate, about halfway down it, by three externally-flush rivets and its rear connecting rivet is a leather band to which a lining-glove was originally attached.\nThe gauntlet shows small rust-perforations over the second finger of the first finger-plate, over the third knuckle of the knuckle-plate, and at several points at the rear inside of the cuff.  The first metacarpal-plate is pierced with a modern wiring-hole just to the front of centre, and repaired with riveted internal patches at its outer ends."]
