'Graves' inscribed in graphite on the verso and on the secondary support at lower centre. Head and shoulders portrait of a middle-aged gentleman wearing a top hat and coat with a high collar, in profile facing right. Cut from a larger sheet of etched portrait heads featuring nine print publishers, dealers and collectors after drawings by printseller and publisher, Alexander Beugo (fl.1801-1827) which was published by him in 1814 with the engraved title: 'Portraits from Sketches made at Rare Print Sales'. The British Museum holds two impressions of the plate. See 1876,1209.613, which is inscribed with identifications of the portrait heads on recto and verso and with the production details on the verso, which state that the plate was published by Beugo on 18 January, 1814.
