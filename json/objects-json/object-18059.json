Formed of a long, flared cuff, five metacarpal-plates, a knuckle-plate, a finger-plate and four scaled finger-defences.  The cuff is formed of an outer plate and a considerably shorter inner plate.  The latter is riveted within the former.  The outer plate is medially-ridged and rises at its upper edge to a pronounced central point.  The upper edge of the cuff has a plain inward turn accompanied by a recessed border containing eleven lining-rivets.  A twelfth lining-rivet is lost from the apex of the outer plate.  The lower edge of the inner plate has a plain inward turn.  Riveted within each side of the lower end of the outer plate is a fragment of a leather strap to fasten the gauntlet around the inside of the wrist.  The lower edge of the outer plate is overlapped by a series of five medially-ridged, upward-overlapping lames that are decorated with V-shaped nicks at their centres.  The lowest metacarpal-plate is overlapped by a knuckle-plate decorated with a file-roped transverse rib of boxed form.  The lower edge of the knuckle-plate overlaps a finger-plate which is shaped to the fingers.  The cuff, the metacarpal-plates, the knuckle-plate and the finger-plates are all connected to one another at their outer ends by round-headed rivets with octagonal internal washers.  Riveted within the finger-plate are four finger-defences formed of between six and eight medially-ridged scales riveted to underlying leather strips.  The third scale of the first finger appears to be replaced.  Attached within the front edge of the gauntlet by the rivet that connects the fourth and fifth metacarpal-plates to one another is a fragment of the leather hinge that would have served to attach the missing thumb-defence. Part of the composite armour HEN.M.20A-H-1933."]
