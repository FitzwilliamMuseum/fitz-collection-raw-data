        "value": ["A small catalogue (8.5\" x 5.5\") of thin wove paper and letterpress; 36 pp. Printed on the front page at upper left and right with the series number: 'No. 35' and the date: '1924'. The title: 'A CATALOGUE OF / MISCELLANEOUS BOOKS / Many Suitable for Xmas Presents or New Year Gifts / IN ALL CLASSES OF LITERATURE: ... Offered for Ready Money at affixed prices, by / R.S. FRAMPTON / \"WALTON HOUSE,\" 37 FONTHILL ROAD, FINSBURY PARK / LONDON, N.4.'. Valentines are listed on pp. 35 and 36 with various lot descriptions between 747 and 759 missing. Of the listed valentines, four can be found in Glaisher's collection: lot 748: P.14410-R-25; lot 749: P.14345-R-3 - P.14345-R-10; lot 752: P.14346-R-63; lot 756: P.14346-R-55. Two cuttings from p. 35 of the catalogue relating to lots 747 and 753 were found loose fastened with a paper clip along with several cuttings of articles on valentines from the 1920s, the paper-clipped items contained along with a group of loose valentines inside a large manilla envelope addressed to Eric Chamberlain (Assistant Keeper of Prints at the Fitzwilliam 1962-1975), 4 Grange Gardens, Cambridge and postmarked 1966-04-07. The envelope is inscribed in graphite on the verso with a large number '50', which presumably relates to the number of valentines contained inside. The envelope appears to have been used by Chamberlain as a temporary means to store a number of loose Glaisher valentines. It does not appear to be the case that the lots described in the clippings were bought by Glaisher and were presumably just leftovers from those that were pasted into the albums with the purchased lots. These clippings are now stored with Valentinesarchive14."]
