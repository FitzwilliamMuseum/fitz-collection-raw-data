        "value": ["Rapier. Large, tall barrel-shaped pommel, oval in plan, with a well-shaped button. Knuckle-guard, loop-guard, double ring-guards. Branches and single rear quillon, all of a broad ribbon-section. The knuckle-guard terminates against the side of the pommel with a large open ring; at the midpoint it swells to a balustic-shaped feature below which is a flat disc, below which again the lower part of the guard swells to a second balustic-shape; thus the disc id clasped between these two elements. At this point the loop-guard in front of the hilt and the back-guard at the back spring out. Each of the ring-guards show the same feature of a flat disc clasped between the two balustic-like elements. The lower ring encloses an elegantly pierced plate. There is a flat, rectangular ecusson from the lower edge of which springs a short triangular element. The single rear quillon turns strongly towards the blade and terminates, slightly curled inward, in a disc. Each of these discs on the guards and quillon is decorated with a neatly chiselled double-trefoil rose pattern while each of the enclosing balustic forms has, similarly chiselled, a long acanthus leaf. The same motifs, in a diamond shape, are repeated on the pommel. These decorations only appear on the outside of the gilt, the inside being quite plain. The grip is of oval section, bound in a most complex manner with strands of thick and thin twisted wire. The back-guards are of three elements. The hilt retains all of its original blue colour. Long narrow blade of flat diamond section; at the forte, three well-marked fullers, the middle on extruding halfway down toward the point. The stout ricasso, a little narrower than the blade, has its faces slightly dished. In the middle of each face of the ricasso is a stamped, very clear maker's mark, a fleur-de-lis ensigned with a crown within an ecusson.\nNorman hilt type 57."]

An early example in England is on the tiles in St. Mary's Abbey, York; it appears in quantity in the Tudor decoration in the chapel of King's College, Cambridge, among the sculptured Royal badges are crowned Tudor roses and peteullises; there are also 48 examples of it in the glass of the great East Window. Henry V is known to have used it as a badge, as did all the Tudor monarchs and James I. The quantity of this sword is entirely consistent and its having been made by a Master appointed to a royal house."]
