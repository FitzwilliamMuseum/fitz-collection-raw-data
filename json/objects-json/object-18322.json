Formed in one piece with an almond-shaped crown that rises to a backward-directed stalk at its apex, and a flat, narrow, integral brim that projects to an obtuse point at the front and rear.  The brim has a file-roped inward turn accompanied by a narrow, recessed border.  The base of the crown is encircled by twelve round-headed lining-rivets fitted with external brass rosette washers and circular internal washers.  The latter retain the greater part of a linen lining-band and fragments of the leathers for the attachment of the missing cheek-pieces.  A pair of holes at the nape originally served to attach a missing plume-holder.  The left hole is occupied by a round-headed rivet and rosette washer matching the others.  The right hole has at some time been opened out, and then subsequently closed to its original size by welding. The right side of both the crown and the brim have suffered some minor denting."]
