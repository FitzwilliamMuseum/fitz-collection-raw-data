The neck-opening has a file-roped inward turn bordered by a V-shaped rib enclosed by a pair of incised lines.  The arm-openings are each bordered by an incised line and pierced at their upper and lower ends with a rivet-hole for the attachment of a missing gusset.  Pierced just below each armpit is a later wiring-hole.  Pierced to either side of the neck-opening is a rivet-hole for the attachment of a missing shoulder-strap.  Overlapping the lower edge of the main plate, and attached to it at either side by a modern round-headed rivet, is a deep waist-plate which is bordered at its upper edge by a single incised line, and flanged outwards at its lower edge to receive a skirt.  The flange is pierced at either side with a rivet-hole for the attachment of a missing skirt.  Later wiring-holes are pierced just to the outside of each of these rivet-holes, and to either side of the waist, just above the angle of the flange."]

The corslets were conceivably acquired by the Earl when he was appointed Captain of Calais in 1556, and worn by his troops when he led the English contingent to the Battle of St Quentin in 1557."]
