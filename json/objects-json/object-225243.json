        "value": ["Lithograph (uncoloured) on white wove paper. Inlaid within a frame of buff wove paper (approx. height 360mm x width 515mm). A group of five figures in an interior, two seated centrally at a table, a drawing of the new stone-fronted elevation of Apsley House (the Duke of Wellington's residence) with the title' Plan for a Palace' propped up near the fireplace at lower left and a framed picture of Windsor Castle hanging on the wall at upper centre. Wellington (Duke of Wellington; Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, 1769-1852; Prime Minister from 1828 to 1830) stands to the left, his back to the fire, a speech bubble (faint) contains the text: 'I feel for poor Bull's distresses, altho' / I don't think they are nearly so great / as he imagines but you know _Goldbairn_ / we must find money to support My Lord's / dignity & not forgetting ourselves - to pay / the heavy charges on the Estate; as however / we promised the unfortunate fellow some / _abatement_ you may return him a Shilling !!!'. Goulburn (Henry Goulburn, 1784-1856) sits at the table laden with coins and money bags and holds out a coin to 'Bull' (John Bull). A speech bubble (faint) contains the text: 'You hear what My Lord's / Steward says - I am to / return you a shilling'. The figure of John Bull seated opposite exclaims (inside faint speech bubble): 'Anan!'. Two male figures at the far right, the Treasury Secretaries, Planta (Joseph Planta, 1787â€“1847) and Dawson (George Robert Dawson, 1790-1856) confide in one another, with text inside faint speech bubbles above: figure on left (Planta?): 'It can't be of any / relief to him to be / sure, but then it must / be such a consolation / to him _to see so good / a disposition_.'.; figure on right (Dawson?): 'How good / of Master! / It is more than / I expected / he'd do'. The title printed below the border: 'THE ABATEMENT'. The publisher's details printed below, the lower part of the text cropped by the edge of the paper: '[Pubd by] THOMAS McLEAN, [26 Haymarket, 26th Feby, 1830]'. Handwritten in graphite at upper right: '52'. See 16045,_Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires_, Vol. XI, 1828-1832, M.D. George, published 1954, pp. 267. A number '[52]' printed in square brackets in the right-hand margin on p. 267 relates to the handwritten number at upper right, both referencing the sequence of John Doyle's Political Sketches series."]
