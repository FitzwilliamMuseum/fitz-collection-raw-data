On the front board: 'Auch ein Todtentanz. / Erfunden und gezeichnet / von / Alfred Rethel. / Leipzig, Verlag von Bernhard Schlicke / (Balthasar Elischer). / 1879'. The series was originally published in 1849 with the title: _Auch ein Todtentanz aus dem Jahre 1848_ [Yet another Dance of Death from the year 1848], but the title appears to have been modified in subsequent editions or formats in which the 'Auch' and/or 'aus dem Jahre 1848' are dropped. See P.14785-R. On the back board: [inside an oval-shaped design of scrolling lines] 'Leipzig, / Druck von Alexander Wiede'. There are the remains of a brown cotton ribbon tie threaded through a slit in the back board. Inside is a front endpaper of grey wove paper with graphite inscription at upper right corner: '4.50' and a bookseller's label at upper left: 'WALTHER & APOLANT / BUCHHANDLUNG BERLIN / MARKGRAFEN-STRASSE 60.'. The back endpaper is overlarge with flaps at upper, lower and right edges which are folded in, envelope-like, to contain the printed material; title page, printed foreward by Johannes Proelss, followed by six individual plates of tinted wood-engravings designed by Alfred Rethel with explanatory text printed below composed by Robert Reinick. All the plates are tinted in yellow, straw-coloured tones of varying hue. The wood-engravings in the first edition are untinted; see P.14786. This impressively presented portfolio, which includes a foreward by well-known German journalist and literary historian, Johannes Proelss, is the eleventh edition of Rethel's counter-revolutionary wood-engraved series, _Auch ein Todtentanz_ and was published on the 30th anniversary of the original publication of the series in 1849 and twenty years after Rethel's death in 1859; ff.1r-10v.                                                          f1r - Title page; one half of a large, folded sheet of white wove paper enclosing the foreward and plates; with lettering in gothic script, printed in black ink: 'Auch ein Todtentanz. / Erfunden und gezeichnet / von / Alfred Rethel. / Mit erklärendem Text / von / Robert Reinick. / Ausgeführt im akademischen Atelier für holzschneidekunst zu Dresden unter Leitung von Professor h.
