The circular mound base has three lobes at the front, and its concave underside has a ventilation hole near the back. The glaze has a greenish tinge. The top is decorated with rococo scrolls in low relief and applied flowers and leaves. The figure is supported by a tree stump with one branch on the viewer's right, and two on the left, bearing applied flowers and leaves. At its base at the back there is a square aperture to take an attachment, probably a candle branch. The musician stands on his right leg with the left relaxed beside it. He holds a flageolet to his lips with his left hand, and with his right, holds a drumstick with which he is striking a tabour attached to his waist. He wears a yellow hat with a gold edge and a dark puce, a red, and a blue feather at the front. He has a white shirt with a turquoise bow on the left wrist, a dark puce jacket with gold buttons, a dark blue waistcoat with gold edge, turquoise breeches with puce and gold flowers in reserves, and puce bows at the knee, pale yellow stockings, and black shoes with gold buckles. A bag is suspended over his hip by a strap. The edge of the base is picked out in turquoise, green, and gold, and the flowers on its top are respectively dark puce, red, blue, and partly blue."]
