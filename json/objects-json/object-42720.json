The unglazed underside has a large central ventilation hole through which the partly glazed interior can be seen.  The base is rectangular with cut corners, and fluted sides, which have a gold line round the top and bottom edges. The poet stands with his right leg crossed over his left, leaning on his right elbow on a pile of three books resting on top of a three-sided pedestal. With his left hand he points to an inscription on a scroll handing down from below the books. His hair and beard are brown, and he has ruddy cheeks, and red lips.  He wears a close-fitting jacket, with gold decoration on the front, and gold buttons; breeches with gold buttons and a band at the knee; a long cloak with a pink lining and gold edges, and shoes with gold ties on top. The pedestal is decorated on the angles with heads of Henry V, Richard III, and Queen Elizabeth with volutes below. The books are red and gold, green and purple, and purple and yellow. The scroll is inscribed in gold in capital letters:\nTHE CLOUD CAPPED TOW[ERS] . . .\nTHE GORGEOUS PALACES\nTHE SOLEMN TEMPLES\nTHE GREAT GLOBE itself ….\nYEA, ALL WHICH [IT INHERIT] ……\nSHALL DISSOLVE\n[LIKE] THE [BASELESS]\n[FABRIC OF A] VISION\n[LEA]VE NOT A WRECK\nBEHIND"]
