Sticks and guards of ivory pierced, silvered and gilt (14+2);  the guards backed in red foil and mother-of-pearl.  Rivet set with clear pastes.  Front:  In the middle is a shaped oval cartouche painted with an outdoor conversation piece: a gentleman standing beside two ladies who are seated on a bank in front of a pedestal surmounted by an urn, and are glancing  apprehensively at a small boy on the left, who is holding a cage; a small dog approaches the group from the right.  On each side there is a smaller scene:  on the left a still life comprising a melon and a slice of melon, two glasses of wine, a bottle and some fabric grouped in front of a bushes and a garden pedestal surmounted by a ball;  on the right, a quiver of arrows, a bow, a flaming heart, two doves and forget-me-nots grouped in front of trees with a pedestal surmounted by a ball on the left.  The painted areas are enclosed by scrolls and loops of embroidered sequins and beads;  the loops flanking the central scene enclose painted purple feathers, and those over the lateral scenes enclose dark pink feathers.   In addition there are sprays of flowers in the spaces between the feathers.  The left, upper and right edges have borders of gold and red lines, elongated Ss, vases and flowers.  Reverse:  In the centre a spray of pink flowers and foliage flanked by smaller sprays.  The outlines of the scrolls and loops on the front are painted in red.  Sticks: Finely pierced with diaper patterns, circular medallions containing scrolls, oval and shaped cartouches containing flowers, outlined in silver and gold foil.  Guards:  On the upper part, a tapering panel pierced by diaper work and a trophy, backed by red foil and mother-of-pearl.  Below, formal motifs and flowers."]
