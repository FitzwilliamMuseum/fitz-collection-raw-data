The silver-grey ground of the lid and sides is decorated in gold, silver-grey, black and red hiramakie (low-relief sprinkled design) and togidashi  (brought out by polishing) with aogai (small pieces of blue-green inlaid shell) details with genre scenes.  The lid is ornamented with a design of the tea ceremony; two ladies sit on a verandah in front of a screen, which is decorated with birds in branches, and beside a willow tree.  They are surrounded by seated musicians and attendants; two maids bring in tea.  The sides are similarly decorated, one long side with a willow tree in landscape; one short side with two figures with swords, and one wearing a hat and carrying a staff beside a willow; the other long side shows a nobleman and lady both carrying swords walking beside two willow trees with an attendant behind and a boy with a staff before them; the fourth side shows a lady in red with two swords following an attendant.  The middle section (B) has a nashiji interior and contains the four smaller boxes and lids (G, H, I, J).  The lids are individually decorated, one with red and gold scale pattern in a diagonal zig zag  against a black and gold powdered ground; one with a band of red and gold diaper pattern over a black and gold powdered ground, one with two silver-grey and gold cranes on the branch of a willow tree on a black and gold powdered ground, and the fourth box with gold and grey flowering hagi on a red and gold lacquer ground.  The four boxes all have fundame (matt gold) sides and the interiors and the bases are nashiji (shimmering spangles).  The interior and the base of the lower section are in nashiji and the interior of the lid is nashiji."]
