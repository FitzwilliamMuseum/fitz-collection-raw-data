        "value": ["A pair of modern fingered gauntlets, for use by a cuirassier. The gauntlets are each formed of a moderately short, flared tubular cuff, five metacarpal-plates, a knuckle-plate, four scaled finger-defences and a scaled thumb-defence.  The cuff is formed of an inner and an outer plate.  The former is riveted within the latter.  The upper edge of the outer plate rises to an obtuse central point.  The short inner plate has a slightly convex upper edge and a slightly concave lower edge.  The upper edges of both plates and the lower edge of the inner plate have plain inward turns.  The lower edge of the outer plate is overlapped by a series of five upward-overlapping metacarpal-plates and a knuckle-plate.  The knuckle-plate is decorated at its upper end with a weak, transverse rib.  Its lower edge is scalloped over each finger and weakly shaped between them.  The cuff, the metacarpal-plates and the knuckle-plate are connected to one another at their outer ends by round-headed rivets.  Riveted within the knuckle-plate is a series of four finger-defences formed of between four and five downward overlapping scales secured by single rivets to an underlying leather strip.  The final scale of each defence has a rounded terminal. The second finger-defence of the left gauntlet is missing.  Attached by a leather hinge to the front end of the fifth metacarpal plate by the same rivet that articulates the latter to the knuckle-plate is a thumb-defence of three downward-overlapping scales, of which the last two match those of the finger-defences.  The first scale or main-plate of the thumb-defence is of lozenge-shaped outline with a truncated lower end.  It is medially-ridged above the point of the knuckle and transversely-stepped to the rear of it.  The workmanship of the gauntlets and the freshness of their edges shows them to be modern reproductions. Part of the composite three-quarter armour HEN.M.18A-F-1933."]
