I wanted a Gothic suit but parted with a rare piece'.  The jack, from a house in Tonbridge, Kent, is now part of the Bashford Dean Memorial Collection in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.

Formed of a central plate, a pair of side-plates, and a later-associated waist-plate and modern skirt of four lames.  The backplate has straight upper and lower edges.  The lateral edges of the central plate diverge upwards and outwards to bisect the arm-openings which have plain, outward turned edges.  They overlap the inner edges of the side-plates and are secured to them by three modern, round-headed rivets with circular, internal washers in each case.  Secured within each of the upper corners of the central plate by a pair of modern, round-headed rivets with circular or octagonal internal washers is a modern, bifurcated, leather shoulder-strap.  The upper edge of the central plate is pierced at its centre with a pair of lace-holes.  Fitted within the lower edge of the backplate is a waist-plate which is retained by three modern, round-headed rivets with circular, internal washers:  one at the centre of the main plate, and another at the outer end of each of the side-plates.  Attached by a modern, round-headed rivet at either side of the waist-plate is a modern leather strap, the left of which terminates in a plain, single-ended, modern, iron buckle.  The lower edge of the waist-plate is flanged outwards to receive the skirt of four upward-overlapping lames of which the fourth is deeper than the rest and descends to an obtuse point at the centre of its lower edge.  The lames are connected to one another and to the waist-plate at each side by modern, round-headed rivets with circular, internal washers.  The centre of the fourth lame is decorated with a pair of horizontally aligned modern, round-headed rivets. Part of the composite Spanish armour M.13A-K-1941."]
