Leaves 3v-18v are paginated \"1\"-\"30\"; leaves 19-70 have an original foliation \"30\"-\"80\", leaves 74-97 have an original foliation \"1\"-\"24\"\nFormer shelf mark: 52.D.25.\nFormer owners: John Bull, Joseph Ames, with his armorial book plate lettered \"AMES of NORFOLKE\".\nBinding: full leather with gilded decorative tooling on sides and spine and gilded gauffered edges, with \"IOHN BULL / DOCTOR OF / MUSIQVE ORG/ ANISTE AND GENT / ELMAN OF HER MAIES /TIES MOSTE HONORABLE / CHAPPELL\" on the front cover, and \"IOSEPH AMES\" blind stamped in the oval of the central strap-work panel on both covers."]
