        "value": ["Burgonet, for light field use, decorated with bands in the 'black and white' fashion. Formed of a skull with an integral peak, a pair of hinged cheek-pieces and a  neck-defence of one lame.  The rounded skull rises to a high medial comb which is file-roped along its crest.  The short peak projects forwards and slightly upwards to an obtuse central point.  Its front edge has a file-roped inward turn, as does the lower edge of the neck-defence which is also obtusely pointed.  A leather lining-band is riveted within the brow and nape of the skull.  The cheek-pieces, which are attached by internal hinges, are of fairly square form, with cropped rear corners at the hinges.  Their upper front corners are notched to fit over the rear ends of the peak.  Their lower edges, which have file-roped inward turns, are flanged outwards to form a continuation of the neck-defence.  Each cheek-piece is pierced at its centre with five small, circular ventilation-holes in rosette-formation.  Riveted within the neck of each cheek-piece is a leather loop to tie them together.  The right loop is incomplete. Differences in the character of its roped edge, and a lack of bevelling at its rear edge, indicates that the left cheek-piece is  a later replacement. Part of the composite half armour HEN.M.3A-E-1933"]
