Front:  Two military scenes.  The broader band, on top, has two soldiers sitting in front of a tent behind drums; one is standing with a spear in a boat on the river that cuts off a castle in the background.  In the central background there is a sailing boat; on the right there is a soldier in a boat and a dark wall; on the left a soldier is standing next to a woman in front of a house smoking a pipe.  The narrower band shows a soldier in a tent, flanked by trees and water.  Both bands are bordered by flowers and slightly scrolling leaves, and have gold edgings.  Back:  on both bands there are scenes of a building on a small island with trees, surrounded by water; the borders are of flowers and leaves.  Sticks:  between the leaves, each stick has a lozenge surrounded by four circles.  The lower part of the sticks is decorated with loose sprays of flowers.  Back: undecorated.  Guards:  the front guard is decorated with blue and pink slightly scrolling leaves, flowers and fruit on the top and the background has pink leaves and fruit in the middle as well as on top."]
