        "value": ["Backplate with skirt, for field use. Formed of a main plate, weakly shaped to the shoulder-blades, and a skirt of one lame.  The nearly straight neck-opening and the arm-openings of the main plate have file-roped inward turns accompanied by a recessed border.  Attached by a pair of externally-flush rivets within each of the upper corners of the main plate is a modern, buff leather shoulder-strap with a bifurcated proximal end.  Attached by a round-headed rivet with a circular external rosette washer and a circular, internal washer at each side of the waist is a modern leather strap that serves as a waist-belt.  The rosette washers are decorated with punched hatching.  The left strap terminates in a modern double-ended, tongued, iron buckle with a rounded hasp secured by a single round-headed rivet.  The buckle has a rectangular distal loop and a D-shaped proximal loop decorated with file-roping.  A later hole pierced at the centre of the upper border of the main plate has subsequently been plugged with an externally-flush rivet.  Later wiring-holes are pierced at the centre of the waist and the lower end of each arm-opening.  The lower edge of the main plate is flanged outwards to receive the skirt of one lame.  The upper edge of the lame is decorated with a pair of modern incised lines.  Its nearly straight lower edge is decorated with a file-roped inward turn accompanied by a recessed border.  Each end of the border is pierced with a later large, circular hole, possibly for wiring-purposes.  The skirt-lame is attached to the flange of the main plate at each side by a single, modern round-headed rivet with an octagonal internal washer. Part of the composite three-quarter armour HEN.M.11A-H-1933"]
