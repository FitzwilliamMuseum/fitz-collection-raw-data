A trellis and vine visible in the background. An inscription in graphite on the verso: 'DDeuchar'. This print was included in Deuchar's series of 375 etchings which were published in Edinburgh in 1803 under the title, _A Collection of Etchings after the Most Eminent Masters of the Dutch and Flemish Schools, Particularly Rembrandt, Ostade, Cornelius Bega and Van Vliet, Accompanied with Sundry Miscellaneous Pieces and a Few Original Designs by David Deuchar_. The collection seems to have been printed for private circulation among Deuchar's friends. The design of this etching probably originates from Deuchar himself rather than being a copy after another artist. This impression was most likely cut from a sheet of plates. See Notes."]
