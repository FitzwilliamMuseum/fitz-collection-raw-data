        "value": ["Etching on paper. A street-scene with building and mullioned window with leaded panes in the background. Two full-length figures; on the left, an elderly gentleman wearing a wig and seen in profile facing right wearing a tricorn hat and with a hole in the right elbow of his coat. He carries a basket containing a bunch of herbs in his left hand and another under his left arm. He walks from left to right with a stick held in his right hand; on the right, an old woman wearing a straw bonnet over a mob cap and wearing a shawl and apron. Her sleeves are rolled up and she carries a flat, shallow basket under her left arm and another basket containing objects in her right hand. Scratched onto the plate at lower right: 'T. Orde inv.t et fecit. 1768'. The old woman bears a strong similarity to the female figure portrayed in P.14879-R, a proof signed by Orde, which features a female figure carrying a similar shallow basket under her arm and which is inscribed on the verso, 'Mother Hammond / Fruitseller at Cambridge'. This work was included in the exhibition of portraits and caricatures from the Cambridge Antiquarian Society's collection and the Fitzwilliam Museum, held at the Fitzwilliam in 1908 and listed in the catalogue in the section 'Cambridge Caricatures' as no. 6, 'A Portrait'. P.14883-R is listed as No. 8 in the catalogue, identified as [Randal & Hammond] (no. 2). See Notes."]
