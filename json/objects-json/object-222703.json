Crypt. Consumption.” on page 8, “The third examination of conscience” which Denis used to create Couple. Which is his own title.  I had written that sequence of poems shortly before I met up with Denis for the first time, and was thrilled that he filleted out those lines for his initial creative response. I love his cover, and its connection to Couple. And I especially love the way Denis morphed a scan of his own hairy and living forearm to the image of real vellum!”"]
