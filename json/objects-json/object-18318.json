Formed in one piece with an almond-shaped crown that rises to a short, backward-directed 'stalk' at its apex; and a narrow integral brim that is turned down slightly all round and projects as a rounded point at the front and rear.  The edge of the brim has a file-roped inward turn accompanied by a narrow, recessed border.  The base of the crown is encircled by eighteen modern, round-headed, brass lining-rivets.  Pierced at the nape, just above the level of the lining-rivets, are a pair of rivet-holes for the attachment of a missing plume-holder.\nThe apex of the crown is etched with four radiating, stylised acanthus leaves.  The brim is etched with trophies, musical instruments, dolphins and fabulous animals and birds on a stippled and blackened ground.  The base of the crown shows traces of narrow etched bands.  The recessed border of the brim is etched with cabling.  The treatment of the etching, taken in conjunction with its freshness relative to the heavily cleaned surface of the helmet as a whole, suggests that  it was applied to the latter in modern times.  From the evidence of the worn, etched bands around the base of the crown, however, it is conceivable that the modern etching either replaces or enhances the remains of earlier etching."]
