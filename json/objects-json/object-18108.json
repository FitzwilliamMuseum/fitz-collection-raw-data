        "value": ["Breastplate and associated tassets, for use by a pikeman. The breastplate is of late 'peascod' fashion with a deep flange at the waist, forming an integral skirt.  Its arm-openings and deep, narrow neck-opening have plain inward turns.  The turns and the upper end of the skirt are each bordered by two rows of round-headed rivets.  The breastplate is decorated with three bands that diverge from the waist to the neck and arm-openings where they merge with similar bands, in each case formed of pairs of deeply-incised lines.  Each side of the chest is pierced with a pair of holes that would originally have been fitted with a pierced stud and swivel-hook to engage the shoulder-straps of the backplate.  Each side of the breastplate is pierced with a pair of rivet-holes, probably for the attachment of hasps to connect it to the backplate.  The upper end of the skirt is decorated with a raised band accompanied by a single incised line.  Each side of the skirt is fitted with a pair of hinges for the suspension of a pair of tassets.  The outer hinge in each case is of large, elaborate form and attached by a swivel-hook and stud at its upper end, and seven rivets at its lower end.  The inner hinge is of small rectangular form and attached by a single rivet top and bottom.  The rectangular tassets are each formed in one piece and embossed to simulate seven lames.  Each lame is decorated at its upper edge with a single incised line.  The lower and lateral edges of the tassets have plain, inward turns accompanied by recessed borders containing round-headed lining-rivets.  Each tasset is decorated with three vertical lines of round-headed rivets. Part of the composite pikeman's armour HEN.M.24A-B-1933."]
