Sticks of pierced and painted ivory with a zone of chinoiserie, guards of carved ivory, encrusted with reddish wood, ebony coloured wood and bone, partly backed with foil.(22+2).  Rivet set with clear pastes.  Front:  In the centre, three scenes painted as three small pictures lying on top of each other; on top, a shepherd and shepherdess standing in a landscape beside water, with an urn on a pedestal, trees and a folly in the background.  On the left, a well, some classical columns and a pyramid, all painted in blue.  On the right, in brown, a man pouring water into a trough; in the background a cistern with an urn on top.  The scenes are on a painted blue and white lace ribbon (Mechlin?),  which is backed by a brown and gold trellis pattern with dots in the corners.  The centre is flanked by two scenes in blue, wavy scrolls surrounded by flowers; on the left, a boy kneeling in front of a woman, a boy standing next to them; in the background there is a house behind a wall.  On the right, a couple playing a game of cards is worked.  The top edging is of a green and gold line; left, right and lower edging are of a single gold line.  There are gold square ornaments with circles on a brown background at the top corners of the leaf.  Back: A shepherdess is sitting on a bank under a tree; in the background, there is a little house with a fence in front of a forest.  Sprays of flowers and some wavy ornaments border the scene.  Sticks:  In the centre, a chinoiserie scene with two seated people on a table and on the left, a classical ruin painted in blue and on the right, painted in brown, probably a squirrel attacking a basket of grapes, which has turned over.  The three scenes, which follow the colour concept of the main scenes of the leaf, are bordered by a gold scrolling ornament.  There is a Chinese-style rose on the reverse of the back guard; the first and second sticks have sprays of roses, the twenty-first and twenty-second sticks show a bird and an insect.  The lower part of the sticks is pierced to show a lacy pattern when the fan is open.  Reverse decorated with a little gold flower arrangement in the centre.  Guards:  Both guards are decorated in a similar way.  The shoulder has encrusted striations of wood and ivory; the guard proper is carved, pierced and backed with puce foil on the top and bottom.  In the middle, two wooden lines border an encrustation looking like a diagonal chessboard with bone and painted wood."]
