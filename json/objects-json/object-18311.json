Formed in one piece with an almond-shaped crown that rises to a short, backward-directed 'stalk' at its apex; and a narrow, integral brim that is turned down evenly all round.  The edge of the brim has a file-roped inward turn.  A large section of the right side, and a smaller section of the left side of the brim are each restored with riveted internal patches.  The front and rear of the brim have each been pierced with later wiring-holes.  The front hole has subsequently been plugged with an externally-flush rivet.  The base of the crown is encircled by sixteen modern lining-rivets, all of which are of brass-capped, round-headed form with circular internal washers, except for one at the left side which has a flat, internal head and is externally flush.  The rivets retain a modern leather lining-band.  The central pair of rivets at each side also retain the remains of the connecting-leather for the missing cheek-pieces.\nThe crown of the helmet is decorated with eight vertical bands of etched trophies on a stippled and blackened ground that radiate from its apex which is etched with acanthus foliage.  All eight bands are enclosed to either side by three narrower bands, of which the central one is decorated with guilloche and the other two remain plain.  A band of guilloche enclosed by a pair of plain bands also decorates the base of the skull.  The brim of the helmet is decorated with a band of cabling enclosed by a pair of plain narrow bands."]
