Sticks and guards of shaped and carved tortoiseshell, the latter backed with mother-of-pearl (10+2).  Rivet of tortoiseshell.  Front:  The front leaf is decorated with a classical scene in cool, dark shades of grey and blue.  In the centre a woman is sitting in front of a drapery between two columns watching a man in classical cuirass who is holding a chain over a fire.  On the left, a woman is carrying a jar on her head and two women are sitting in the foreground.  Behind the man, a guard holding a flag and two women sitting on the ground, one is looking into a bowl.  The whole central scene is set on dark clouds.  On the left and on the right, also set on clouds, there are large decorated jars, surrounded by three putti holding up a white drapery.  All scenes are bordered by scrolling silver ornaments and garlands of flowers.  Right and left borders are decorated with vases of flowers, foliage, birds and insects.  The top edging is of silver painted ribbon.  Back:  The back is painted in the same shades of colours with figures in classical dress.  In the centre, a couple is sitting under a tree; on the right and left, a woman is sitting on the ground.  The background is decorated with a hilly landscape with an obelisk on the right.  Silver foliage scrolls border the leaf.  Sticks:  two sticks at a time are placed in such a way that the C-shapes of their tops face each other and form and open oval.  The guard and first stick from either sides are decorated with flowers, the next two with butterflies and putti on top, and the two central pairs are decorated in the same way with putti on the bottom, a medallion with two kissing doves on the left, one with a barrel on the right and above two putti; two medallions with profiles facing each other.  Guards:  Both guards are decorated in a similar way; the lower part of the guard matches the sticks, decorated with flowers and a vase in the centre.  The guards proper have a man playing the lute for a girl, over scrolls and garlands of flowers, a vase and an oval medallion showing a woman in profile on top"]
