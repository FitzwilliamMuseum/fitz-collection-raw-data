Laking, A Record of European Armour and Arms, [section on jacks in volume titled 'mail'], now preserved in the library of the Royal Armouries Museum, Leeds.  'I exchanged [a jack] with Dean for a Gothic Spanish suit made up.  I wanted a Gothic suit but parted with a rare piece'.  The jack, from a house in Tonbridge, Kent, is now part of the Bashford Dean Memorial Collection in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.  From its character and condition it is possible that the helmet was one of the many pieces from the armoury of the Knights of St John at Rhodes that Bashford Dean acquired from the Parisian dealer Louis Bachereau. Mr Francis Henry Cripps-Day. Part of the composite Spanish armour M.13A-K-1941. Given by Mr Francis Henry Cripps-Day"]

Of one-piece construction with a medially-ridged, hemispherical crown and a broad, downturned brim projecting as an obtuse point front and rear.  The edge of the brim has a plain, inward turn bordered by eighteen holes for lining-rivets.  Two more such holes may have existed at the front and rear of the brim respectively, but have become obscured by later repairs.  The base of the crown is encircled by twelve holes for lining-rivets, two of which on either side are occupied by externally-flush rivets.\nThe skull is pierced with numerous holes, some of which are man-made, and some the result of corrosion.  Large holes at the top rear of the skull, and two smaller holes at the left of the brow have been repaired with riveted and welded internal patches, as has a large section of the left edge of the brim.  Large cracks in the centre of both the front and rear of the brim have been repaired by brazing. Part of the composite Spanish armour M.13A-K-1941."]
