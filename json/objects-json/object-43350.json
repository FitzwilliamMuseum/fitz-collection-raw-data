The unglazed underside has a large circular central ventialation hole, and three patch marks. The circular high mound base has a wavy edge, and pierced sides decorated with applied seaweed, coral, and realistic shells of different shapes and sizes coloured naturalistically.     Neptune stands on a large white ribbed shell picked out in gold which rests on top of the mound. His left leg is forward, and his right extended behind him. His head is turned to his left, and he looks downwards. His left arm is raised to hold a metal trident (see notes). His right arm is held across his body and with his right hand he holds up a drape which billows out behind him. He has long greyish-black hair, and a beard, and wears a white, gold, and red crown on his head. His drape is white with a red, blue, and gold floral pattern, and is lined with pink. Behind him is a dolphin, facing to the right, with water flowing out of its mouth and down the side of the mound. Its scales are green, and it has pale orange-red fins and tail, and a round black eye with a narrow orange-red circle and a wide yellow circle round each. Its upper lip is pale brown with black markings."]
