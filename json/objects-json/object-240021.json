Christ sits at a table, his twelve disciples gathered around him to left and right. There is a halo of light around his head and he looks upwards, his right hand blessing a loaf of bread held in his left hand. A goblet of wine stands at the centre of the table. Judas sits in the left foreground, the only figure to look out towards the spectator and away from Christ. The location is a baroque temple with solomonic columns and arches and a large curtain is draped above the central scene. An open book rests on a stand between two candles on a ledge at upper left with a view to open sky above."]
