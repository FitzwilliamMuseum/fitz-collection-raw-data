He is prevented by an angel, representing Queen Anne of Great Britain, who holds an olive branch. Lady Charlotte Schreiber states that this scene refers to the conclusion of the Treaty of Utrecht, March 30th, 1713, but which she concludes 'must be a mistake'. Her dating of the publication of the Marlborough's Victories cards is given as between December 9th 1707 and October 28th 1708. See, _ Playing Cards of Various Ages and Countries Selected from the Collection of Lady Charlotte Schreiber_, vol. 1, English, Scottish, Dutch and Flemish, edited by Lady Charlotte Schreiber, John Murray, London, 1892.\nFrom a complete pack of 52 playing-cards commemorating the victories of the Duke of Marlborough in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714). Spades satirise the French and Spanish enemy, the other three suits represent scenes from the campaigns, mostly in the Netherlands, also in Spain and Belgium; the aces, court and some numeral cards are portraits or satirical or allegorical scenes.\nA museum catalogue card is included with the pack and pasted with a printed cutting from a sale catalogue, which has been crossed out in graphite: 'CARDS, A Pack of 52 Curious old Engraved Cards / representing Humourous and Comical Scenes, Military / Portraits of Blucher, Wellington, etc. National Emblematic Figures etc. engraved by L. OSIANDER, scarce'. A graphite inscription written on the card below: 'Pack of 52 line-engraved cards, of historical scenes & personages relating to the War of the Spanish Succession.'. The verso is blank.\nThe pack of cards and catalogue card are contained inside a folded manilla envelope inscribed in ink in a calligraphic hand: 'Marlborough's Victories / A pack of 52 cards / Reproduced in _Playing Cards [of various ages and countries] / selected from the collection of Lady Charlotte Schreiber_, Vol. 1, plates / 35-38 / See also _BM Satires_, vol.
