The colours are few, and simple. / I send also a drawing of one of the heads and part of / a nimbus and wing, with tesserae arranged in the way / I feel the mosaic should be executed - if the / workmen had this set up before them I believe it / would help them -- they would soon fall into the / way of designing the flow of the lines, and although at / first the work might go slowly, and prove even costley / I believe you would not regret it. I cannot / enough repeat and insist on this point that the / tesserae should not be driven up close to each other / but that a good ('space' (crossed out)) reasonable space should be / left of mortar between them - and that the tesserae / should often be rounded ('and shaped' (crossed out)) at the edges a little / and triangular bits here and there used - and all..."]
