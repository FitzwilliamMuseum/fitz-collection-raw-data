The armour is decorated on the breastplate, the backplate, the third lame of the pauldron and the outside of the upper cannon of the vambrace with an etched linear design of curved rays that diverge downwards and outwards and are separated by circular or oval pellets. On the breastplate (M.1.2B-1936) the rays issue between a pair of adorsed, scrolling acanthus leaves, from the mouth of a grotesque mask, and are surmounted at their centre by a crowned eagle in display. Stylised acanthus foliage also decorates the centre of the border of the neck. On the backplate (M.1.2C-1936), the rays issue between a pair of adorsed, scrolling acanthus leaves, from the base of an urn, and are separated at their base by a pair of adorsed, stylised acanthus leaves. The rays on the third lame of the pauldron (M.1.2A-1933) are also separated at their base by stylised foliage. The rays on the lower cannon issue from a circular pellet. The decoration is gilt throughout against a blued ground. The main and subsidiary edges of all preserved parts of the armour are also gilt, as are their decorative raised ribs."]
