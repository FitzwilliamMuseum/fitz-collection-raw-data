Front:  In the centre, two women and a shepherd in classical dress; beside them, two kneeling, working men and two sheep.  On the left, a man with a pipe and a woman with an open book of music on her lap, both sitting in contemporary dress; on the right, a woman kneeling behind a bush offering a man some fruit on a tray. There is a continuous background with trees and a high wooden fence in the centre, a cottage and a well on the left, and a wooden arch and a building on the right.  Floral ornaments partly gilded flank the scene.  There are fine gold lines on the inside top and lower edging, which is made of gold foil.  Back:  A woman is sitting under a tree close to a bank with an open book of music on her lap.  Sprays of flowers with gold twigs and leaves border the scene.  Sticks:  the medallion in the centre shows four figures, one of them in a Roman cuirass and helmet pointing to another figure.  Two identical couples flank the cartouche, a woman with an open book on her lap and a gentleman.  Above the side scenes, similar chinoiseries, two pierced medallions and a medallion with birds; free spaces are filled with floral ornaments.  Reverse undecorated.  When closed, the sticks show a carved flower with scrolling leaves.  Guards:  the shoulder of both guards is decorated in a similar way with a flower on the bottom, a flower and slightly scrolling ornaments in the middle and a vase of flowers on top.  The guard proper of the front guard has a flower, a standing woman and a kneeling, winged putto.  The back guard has a more formal design with a vase of flowers, an oval medallion with a pierced pattern, and a standing man in Roman cuirass."]
