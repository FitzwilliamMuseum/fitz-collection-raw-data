The lower half of the reinforce is shaped to the shoulder, the armpit and the top of the chest. The outside of the shoulder and the centre of the haute-piece are each strongly boxed along a vertical ridge. The upper edge of the haute-piece rises to an obtuse point at the top of the ridge, and has strongly rounded corners. It has a file-roped inward turn accompanied by a recessed border, as does the convex edge of the portion of the reinforce that extends over the chest. The lower edge of the portion of the reinforce that extends over the shoulder is decorated with a pair of incised lines. Single incised lines mark the V-shaped base of the haute piece, and the division between the portions of the reinforce that extend over the chest and the shoulder. The reinforce is pierced just below the base of the haute-piece, and a short distance to the inside of its medial ridge with a circular hole to receive the stud or screw that would have secured it to the front of the pauldron. It is further pierced at its lower outer corner with a horizontal keyhole-slot that would have engaged a turning-pin that protruded from the lower end of the pauldron."]
