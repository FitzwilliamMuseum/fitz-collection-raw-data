        "value": ["'Almain' collar, for use by the harquebusier, lacking its integral spaudlers. Formed of a single plate front and rear.  The medially-ridged front plate slopes in slightly to a  low, rounded cusp at each side, and then more sharply beneath them to a  central point.  The lower edge of the rear plate has a slightly convex lower edge which is pierced with a pair of lace-holes at its centre.  Both plates contribute to an upward-flanged neck-opening which has a plain inward turn at its neck.  The front and rear plates are connected to one another at the left shoulder by a modern round-headed rivet with an octagonal internal washer, and are fastened to one another at the right shoulder by means of a modern mushroom-shaped stud riveted to the rear plate engaging a keyhole slot pierced in the front plate.  The stud is fitted with a square internal washer.  The collar was originally equipped with integral spaudlers connected by three internal leathers at each side: two in the rear plate and one in the front plate, attached by a single externally-flush rivet in each case.  The front right rivet projects internally as a flat-headed stud onto which the end of the leather could be buttoned.  The front left and both of the rear rivets retain fragments of their leathers.  The central rivets have been replaced by ones with round heads and square internal washers that secure modern buff-leather straps for the attachment of later-associated pauldrons. Part of the composite half armour HEN.M.10A-G-1933"]
