        "value": ["Backplate for heavy field or possibly siege use, with etched decoration. Formed of a single plate of unusually great weight, slightly shaped to the shoulder blades.  The straight neck-opening and the arm-openings are decorated with roped ribs at their edges in imitation of turns.  The left end of the rib at the neck has later, filed, transverse lines.  The upper corners of the backplate are each pierced with a pair of rivet-holes for the attachment of shoulder-straps or, more probably, hasps.  The slightly convex sides of the backplate are each pierced with five holes, possibly for the attachment of extension-plates that were fitted within the edges.  They are represented by impressions in the corrosion-products of the inside of the backplate as well as by a fragment of one of the plates retained by a pair of externally-flush rivets occupying the top two holes on the left side.  The remains of similar rivets also occupy the lowest three holes on the left side and the top and  central hole on the right side.  The left side is cracked at two points.  The lower edge of the backplate is flanged outwards to receive a skirt.  The skirt was retained by a rivet at each side and by an internal leather secured by a pair of rivets at the centre.  The rivet-holes are now vacant.  The backplate is fitted a short distance in from each side, just above the waist-flange, with a round-headed rivet that secured the missing waist-belt that fastened around the front of the breastplate.\nThe backplate is decorated with finely etched ornament in bands that border the neck and arm-openings respectively.  The ogee-shaped band at the neck-opening and the bands at the arm-openings are each bordered by a pair of narrower bands, of which the outer one is etched with circular pellets on a blackened and stippled ground.  A similar band of pellets decorates the base of the backplate, just above the angle of the waist-flange.  The main ornament consists of scrolling foliage on a blackened and stippled  ground  involving, in the band at the neck-opening, three hounds pursuing a stag, in the bands at the arm-openings, grotesque and dolphin-headed scrolls, cornucopia and ribands, and in the medial band, the figure of St Judith above rectangular cartouches, oval shields and other devices."]
