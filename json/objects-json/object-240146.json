Full-length, William IV seated on a square-backed carved chair in a room with patterned carpet and damask brocade curtain behind and to the right with fringed hem and hanging tassells. He is turned slightly torwards the left looking out at the spectator and wears a dark, double-breasted coat with sash ribbon, the Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic Order (Hanoverian Guelphic Order) around his neck. The insignia of the Order of the Garter is pinned to his coat at the right, the garter worn around his left knee, which is crossed over his right. He holds a book in his lap, the pages marked by the first finger of his left hand. His right hand rests upon a letter signed 'William R' which is on a table to the left. A folded letter inscribed 'The King' is seen on the table beside a writing box containing inkwell with quill and sealing paraphenalia. A book with gilt-tooled decoration and a paper marker stands on the table to the right. At the far left, an open window gives a view onto a colonnaded building set in a landscape."]
