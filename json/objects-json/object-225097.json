The diamond suit is here styled as a lozenge which references the Argyle pattern derived from Scottish Clan Campbell of Argyll. A border of thistle stems and thistle heads with other plant stems tied with a bow (uncoloured) at lower centre. The card is unnumbered. From a pack of 52 playing cards which employs fanciful suits based on French and German models themed according to the countries of the United Kingdom: England (Acorns), Scotland (Diamonds), Wales (Spades) and Ireland (Hearts). The British Museum has a set of these cards (1848,1209.296-349) which includes an uncoloured title-card printed with the publisher's details as follows: 'Baker & Co's Eclectic Cards. For England, Ireland, Scotland & Wales. Sold Wholesale and Retail at their Manufactory, No. 2 King Arthur or New Card Court, York Street, Black Friar's Road, London. N.B. To be had of all Respectable Stationers in the United Kingdom'. This pack is also accompanied by a twelve-page printed pamphlet which gives, 'A short account of Baker and Co.'s Complete, Grand, Historical, Eclectic Cards, for England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, being a selection or an Eclectic Company of Twelve of the most eminent personages that ever distinguished themselves in those respective countries for Heroic Deeds, Wisdom, &c.', and which was printed by Theodore Page, Black Friar's Road in 1813."]
