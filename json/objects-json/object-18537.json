        "value": ["Burgonet, for light field use, with later embossed decoration. Formed of a skull with an integral peak and neck-defence, and a pair of hinged cheek-pieces.  The skull rises to a moderately high medial comb.  The broad, slightly downturned peak projects forward to an obtuse central point.  The narrow, downturned neck-defence projects backwards to an acute central point.  Each cheek-piece has a round upper edge, a centrally-cusped front edge, and short flange at the rear of its lower edge, serving as a continuation of the neck-defence.  Both cheek-pieces are modern restorations.  A modern plume-holder of brass is attached by a pair of rivets at the nape of the skull.\nThe main and subsidiary edges of the helmet are decorated with file-roped inward turns accompanied by shallow recessed borders incised with a simple design of alternating scrolls.  The recessed borders are themselves bordered by an engrailed band embossed in low relief.  The centre of the peak, the centre of the neck-defence and the front and rear ends of the comb are embossed and chased in relief with acanthus foliage.  Each side of the comb is embossed and chased in relief on a stippled ground with scrolling foliage and flowerheads separated at the centre by a medusa's head, repeated on each cheek-piece.  Each side of the crown is decorated with radiating flutes that issue from a semi-circle of radiating lobes at their upper end, and are separated by small fleurs-de-lis at their lower ends."]
