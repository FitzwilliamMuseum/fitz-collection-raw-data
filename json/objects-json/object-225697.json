To each side is a leafy cartouche that on the left inscribed \"Map /of /England/Wales\" topped by a sheaf of corn, and on the right \" Mary Hubbold/ Worcester/ 1798\" topped by a beehive. Both are supported by the depiction of an eagle.\n\nMary Hubbold was born at Leigh, 5 miles from Worcester, in 1781. She married Thomas Doogood on the 22nd Nov. 1803 at St. Martin's, Worcester. She died in Islington, London in 1864.\n St. Martin's was built in 1772 replacing a n much earlier church. It served a closely knit community dominated by small family businesses and their workers.\n\nThe contents of the cartouches, the eagle, sheaf of corn, & beehive probably indicate a family connection to the Masons, the Worcester Lodge being founded in 1790. The Roman eagle (a symbol of Imperial power) in this context probably represents the idea of strength, courage & immortality; the beehive is a symbol of industry and the sheaf of corn, originally representing the fruit of a worker's labour, later became more indicative of charity to the less fortunate."]
