But thou art a bell, / A passing bell, snow-muffled, dim and sweet. / As is the Poet to his fellow-men, / So mid thy drifting snows, O snowdrop, Thou, / Gifted, in sooth, beyond them, but no less / A snowdrop. / And thou shalt complete his lot, / And bloom as fair as now when they are not. / Thou art the wonder of the seasons, O / First-born of Beauty. As the Angel near / Gazed on that first of living things which, when / The blast that ruled since Chaos o'er the sere / Leaves of primeval Palms did sweep the plain, / Clung to the new-made sod and would not drive, / So gaze I upon thee amid the reign / Of Winter. And  because thou livest, I live... / ....... / S. Dobell."]
