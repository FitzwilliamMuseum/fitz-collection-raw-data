        "value": ["Cuirass, of 'anime' form, for field use, with a breastplate of shot-proof weight.  Formed of a breastplate and a backplate, each retaining parts of a later-associated integral collar.\nThe breastplate, which is of late 'peascod' fashion, is formed of nine upward-overlapping lames of which the lowest is flanged outwards to receive a skirt of one lame.  The first is cut at its upper edge with a narrow neck-opening, and the first six are cut away at their outer ends to receive moveable gussets at the arm-openings.  The lames are connected to one another by brass-capped, round-headed sliding-rivets at their outer ends, and by four internal leathers at their centres.  It is possible that the two central leathers replace a single broad central leather.  A double-ended, tongued, iron buckle to receive the shoulder-straps of the backplate, is riveted at each shoulder of the first lame.  Riveted within the upper edge of the first lame is the lowest lame of a collar.  It is medially-ridged, has an obtusely-pointed lower edge, and is pierced at each shoulder with a keyhole-slot to engage mushroom-headed studs formerly riveted at either side of the rear section of the collar.\nThe backplate is formed of eleven upward-overlapping lames of which the lowest is flanged outwards to form a short skirt, the first is cut at its upper edge with a broad, shallow neck-opening, and the first seven are cut away at their outer ends to form arm-openings.  The lames are connected to one another by brass-capped, round-headed rivets at their outer ends, by brass-capped, round-headed rivets at their centres, and by internal leathers located to either side of the latter.  The central row of rivets may possibly replace a further internal leather.  Riveted at each side of the lowest lame is a modern leather strap forming a waist-belt.  The left strap terminates in a single-ended, tongued iron buckle.  Riveted within the upper edge of the first lame are the lowest three lames of a collar.  The lower edge of the lowest lame has a slightly convex lower edge.  The lames are connected to one another with three internal leathers.\nThe main edges of the cuirass and collar have plain inward turns, while the secondary edges are bevelled.   The breastplate and the backplate are each decorated with three slightly diverging bands formed of shallow incised lines, now much rubbed.  Similar incised lines border the arm-openings."]
