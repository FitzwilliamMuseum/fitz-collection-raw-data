        "value": ["Burgonet, for field use. Formed of a skull with an integral peak and a separate, fixed nasal-bar, a hinged right cheek-piece and a neck-defence of one lame.  The rounded skull is formed in two halves joined by a turn to the right along a low medial comb.  The narrow peak, which lacks the rivet at its medial overlap, projects forward to an obtuse central point.  It is pierced at the rear with a square hole to accommodate the sturdy nasal-bar that projects downwards from the brow of the skull where it is attached by a cross-bar welded within its upper end.  The nasal-bar has a convex profile and scrolls forwards at its lower end.  The right cheek-piece originally extended all the way up to the eye, but has been cut to produce a U-shaped face-opening at the same time as the nasal-bar was added.  The left cheek-piece is missing.  It originally overlapped the right cheek-piece medially.  A pierced stud riveted at the inner end of the integral neck-defence of the cheek-piece would have been engaged by a swivel-hook riveted at the inner end of the neck-defence of the left cheek-piece.  The neck-defence, which has a lower rounded edge, is detached at its right side.  The main edges of the helmet have plain inward turns.\nThe nasal-bar and the cutting of the front edge of the cheek-piece represent working-life modifications."]
