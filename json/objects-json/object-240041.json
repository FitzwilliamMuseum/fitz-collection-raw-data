The finished state of Earlom's print references Ovid's telling of the story, 'The Transformation of Hippolytus' with the inscription: \"Vide Ovid Metamorphoses, Book the 15th\". In Ovid, Hippolytus recounts what happened to him as he was driving his chariot along the seashore having been banished by his father, Theseus who falsely believed him to have raped his step-mother, Phaedra. To avenge his wife, Theseus had banished his son and asked his father, Poseidon to curse him. Poseidon sent a monster to frighten Hippolytus' horses so that he could no longer control them and was dragged to his death. The scene shows Hippolytus thrown from his chariot onto a beach, his horses rearing up before the bull/fish monster. Triton blows his conch shell at far left and two figures flee to the right."]
