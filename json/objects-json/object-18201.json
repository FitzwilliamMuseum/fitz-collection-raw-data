I wanted a Gothic suit but parted with a rare piece'.  The jack, from a house in Tonbridge, Kent, is now part of the Bashford Dean Memorial Collection in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.

Each formed of a circular plate decorated around its edge with a file-roped, partial inward turn and at its centre with a low boss rising in two stages between three concentric raised ribs enclosed by pairs of incised lines, to a large, conical-headed rivet at its apex.  The edge is bordered by five and six slotted, round-headed rivets respectively; clearly formed of later screw-heads.  One of these rivets has in each instance been replaced and retains beneath its circular internal washer a long, modern, buff-leather suspension-strap pierced with a hole at its terminal.  On one of the basagues the hole for the rivet that attaches the strap has broken out and subsequently been repaired with an internal patch secured by two externally-flush rivets.  The same basague shows some deformation and cracking at its centre, and lacks a small section of its edge nearly opposite the suspension-strap. Part of the composite Spanish armour M.13A-K-1941."]
