A rotund figure (John Bull) standing to the left of the omnibus holds a pocket watch in his left hand and calls: \"Time\" [contained within a speech bubble]. A portly man wearing a top hat (King William IV, 1765-1837) can be seen inside the carriage through the doorway. The driver at the front of the coach (Sir Robert Peel; Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet, 1788-1850; Prime Minister, 1834–1835 and 1841–1846) holds the reins of the horses in his left hand and a whip in his right. He turns around to confer with another man (Duke of Wellington; Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, 1769-1852; Prime Minister from 1828 to 1830) who stands on the footplate at the back of the coach: \"Is the Gemman [German] in? -\" [contained within a speech bubble], to which the man replies: 'All right! go on Bob\" [contained within a speech bubble]. The artist's initials in monogram at lower left: 'HB'. Printed below the border at lower left: 'Published by T. McLean, 26, Haymarket, Decr 24th 1834'. Printed below the border at lower right: 'Ducôté and Stephen, 70 St Martins Lane'. The title printed below at lower centre: NEW STATE OMNIBUS / or / The Man wot is Cad to the Man wot was Cad to the Man wot drove the Sovereign'. Printed above the border at upper right: 'HB Sketches No. 363.'."]
