He wears a wig and tricorne hat with long coat, stockings and buckled shoes. In scratched letters on the plate below his feet: 'Ars patent omnibus ['open to art']'. In pen and ink in the lower margin: ' Dr Ewin of Cambridge. 1790'. An early proof before letters of a print known as _The Man of Accomodation [sic]_, which George states was etched by Anna Maria Dean after a drawing by 'Mr Porteus of Trin.[ity] Coll.[ege].' See George (BM Satires), 5187. An impression in the British Museum, 1931,0413.445, is located in volume II of Richard Bull's collection of prints by amateurs, and bears an erroneous inscription of 'Dr Ewing'. It is engraved with the title to the left of the image. Ewin was born in Cambridge and studied at St. John's College. He was publically disgraced in 1777 for lending money to William Bird, a scholar at Trinity College, at an exorbitant rate of interest which resulted in the young man being thrown into a debtor's prison. Ewin was later denounced by Lord Mansfield as ‘a corrupter of youth and an usurer’ (DNB, see Notes). P.14876-R is a later proof with the scratched letters partially erased and with hand colouring."]
