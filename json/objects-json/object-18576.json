The edges of the flanges have plain inward turns.  A rivet-hole for the attachment of a buckle is pierced at the top of each shoulder, while a pair of lace-holes is pierced at the centre of the neck-opening.  The lower edge of the breastplate is flanged outwards to  receive a skirt of two upward-overlapping lames, the second of which is deeper than the first and has its plain, inward-turned lower edge cut away in an arch over the crotch.  The lames are connected to one another and to the breastplate at their outer ends by round-headed rivets with octagonal internal washers in the case of the upper two.  All rivets, with the possible exception of the upper left one are replaced.  Later suspension-holes have been pierced beneath each armpit and at either side of the lowest skirt-lame."]

They identify a breastplate in the collections of Schloss Ambrass, near Innsbruck, Inv. No. WA 29, bearing the maker's mark of Oswald Schreiner, as part of the same series (ibid., p.62, No. 45).\nFor information about Hans Seusenhofer and his identified works, see Thomas and Gamber, op. cit., pp. 34 & 64-5."]
