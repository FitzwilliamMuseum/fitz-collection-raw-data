Formed of a main plate covering the chest, and six upward-overlapping lames covering the upper part of the abdomen.  The main plate is cut with a deep, narrow neck-opening and arm-openings that extend into the top two lames of the abdominal section.  The abdominal section has a straight lower edge.  Its lames are connected to one another by three internal leathers.  The rivets for the outer leather now pass through the overlying lames as well.  A further internal leather originally existed between each of the present leathers, making a total of five.  The  upper and lower sections are connected to one another at each side by a sliding-rivet.  Each side of the abdominal section is furnished beneath the armpit with a later rectangular slot and swivel-hook to engage and secure a stud projecting from the backplate.  Riveted at either side of the lowest abdominal plate is an oval loop to receive a waist belt.  The main edges of the breastplate have file-roped inward turns.  The upper edges of the abdominal section are decorated with large scallops bordered by pairs of incised lines.  The main plate is decorated with a pattern of chevrons formed of pairs of incised lines.  Although the upper and lower sections of the breastplate were not originally made for one another, they appear to have been united during their working life."]
