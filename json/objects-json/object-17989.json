        "value": ["Close helmet, for use by a cuirassier, composed of elements of a similar period and fashion. The close helmet is formed of a skull with a peak, an upper bevor and a bevor attached to it by common pivots, and a single gorget-plate front and rear.  The skull is formed in two halves joined medially along a riveted overlap to the right.  The crown of the skull is decorated with radiating flutes of V-shaped section, emphasised by single incised lines.  Riveted at its apex is a pierced finial with a large star-shaped washer, probably replaced.  Attached at the nape by a pair of round-headed rivets is a modern, tapering, tubular plume-holder with integral arms.  The modern pivots that retain the peak, upper bevor and bevor consist of cross-cut, round-headed screws with square internal nuts.  The narrow peak is slightly downturned.  Its front edge projects forward to an obtuse central point.  Its upper edge is decorated with a series of nine low cusps.  The medially-ridged upper bevor is cut at its upper edge with a deep rectangular notch forming the lower edge of a vision-slit that is divided at its centre by a long, upward-projecting bar.  The lower edge of the notch has a file-roped, partial inward turn.  Each side of the upper bevor is pierced with four ventilation-slots that slope outwards very slightly towards their upper end.   A lozenge-shaped ventilation slot over the mouth has been closed by a riveted internal patch.  The medially-ridged bevor is weakly shaped to the chin and cut with a broad U-shaped  face-opening.  Riveted at the right of its neck is a swivel-hook that engages a pierced stud riveted at the front edge of the skull.  The flanged lower edges of the bevor and the skull are respectively fitted with a front and a rear gorget-plate, each of which is formed in one piece.  The lower edge of the front gorget-plate is obtusely-pointed, while that of the rear gorget-plate is rounded.  The main edges of the helmet have plain, inward turns accompanied on the peak and the gorget-plates by recessed borders.  The subsidiary edges of the helmet are bordered by single incised.  Pairs of incised lines decorate the brow of the peak and the upper edge of the upper bevor. Part of the composite three-quarter armour HEN.M.17A-G-1933."]
