In this view Nature truly drawn is / beyond Imagination: what is before you must be better / represented than if absent. But in Opposition to this, Nature, / by great Study, Knowledge and Genius, may be transcended, / by collecting beautiful parts from a many, to form one. / This has been exemplified in some justly celebrated and / exquisite Greek Statues now existing. This has made it / conjectured that they were equally great in all departments / of Art: but I do think the Greeks were not so great in Painting / as Sculpture, nor do any of their remains shew any thing / to prove it, for the Prints FROM them, are better than the / Originals: nor even do any ancient Descriptions give us the / Idea of a fine Historical Picture.
