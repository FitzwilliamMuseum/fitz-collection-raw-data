The square base has four scroll feet with a rocaille motif pierced by a heart between the front two. The underside of each foot is unglazed. The figure is supported at the back by a tall tree stump with a Y-shaped branch on each side bearing two applied flowers and leaves. At the base of the stump at the back there is a square aperture to take an attachment. Harlequin stands on his left leg with his right leg forward, his foot resting between two applied flowers on the front edge of the base. He leans back and to his right slightly, his left hand resting on his chest, and his right hand held out in front holding a slap stick which passes under his right arm. He wears a black carnival mask with eyebrows and whiskers, a pale purple hat with a turned back brim and gold scalloped edge. His jacket and trousers are patterned overall with triangles of different colours, and he has salmon-pink shoes with gold buckles. The tree has two blue flowers and two pink flowers, and there is a blue flower and a yellow flower on the top of the base. The base is picked out in pale green and two shades of purple."]
