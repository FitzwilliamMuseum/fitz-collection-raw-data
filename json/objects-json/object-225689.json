The remainder of the sampler  surrounded by densely worked large detached motifs of flower baskets, bouquet, birds and smaller crowns and stylised floral motifs (similar to Berlin Woolwork patterns).The who;le is enclosed by a strawberry border.\nThe linked octagon band is indicative of a Norfolk provenance, ref. The Norfolk Sampler Tradition. J.M. Lukacher. 2013.  Comparable to samplers made by Eliza Shrimplin, 1810, p256/7 & Susannah Baker, p 242/243.\n\nJulian(a) Greenwood b.20 July 1831 to Matthew & Mary, baptised 31 July, St. Augustine's, Norwich.\nMatthew Greenwood was a wool stapler/dealer, several similar in the parish register. The church contains a monument to Thomas Clabburn , weaving factory owner. The Shrimplin family are believed to have lived in the neighbouring parish so there may have been a school or teacher attended by the children of both families."]
