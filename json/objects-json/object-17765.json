      {
        "value": ["Collar, for field or tournament use. Formed of three upward overlapping lames front and rear. The front three lames are medially-ridged. The top lame in instance has a prominent, file-roped, inward turn at its upper edge. The turn is bordered by five externally-flush rivets at the front, and six at the rear, in each case retaining a modern, buff-leather lining-band. The third lame at both the front and rear is considerably deeper than the rest. The lower edge of the front one descends to an obtuse point at its centre and midway along each side, while that at the rear one is gently convex. The lames are connected to one another by three modern, internal leathers front and rear. The leathers are retained by pairs of externally-flush rivets. The right rear leather is incomplete, and the left rear leather is partly torn through. The outer of the rivet-holes in the third rear lame and the inner of the rivet-holes in the second rear lame for the attachment of the right leathers are now vacant. Later holes pierced just below and to the inside of the outer rivet in the second rear lame for the right rear leather are broken out to the lower edge of the lame. The rivet itself has been replaced by one with a round head. The rivet passes through a construction-hole in the overlying third rear lame, thereby rigidly riveting the second and third rear lames to one another. The outer of the rivets for the right leather in the second front lame is omitted. The central leather at the front was at one time attached to the third lame by a third rivet located just above and between the original pair of rivets. This later rivet has since been removed leaving vacant holes in both the lame and the leather. Construction-holes in the second and third lames aligning with the outer of the rivet-holes for the outer leathers in the underlying lames are occupied by modern purely decorative, round-headed rivets. Vacant rivet-holes pierced near the outer ends of the lower edge of the third rear lame may originally or at some time have served to secure a lining. The same is true of rivet-holes pierced to either side and a short distance above the lower edge of the third front lame. These are now occupied by externally-flush rivets that secure modern internal leathers. The leathers have been cut off but may at some time have served to attach shoulder-defences. Similar cut-off, modern, internal leathers are secured by externally-flush rivets at either side of the third rear lame. The rivets occupy holes that would originally have served to secure external straps for the attachment of shoulder-defences. The original straps have been replaced by later straps secured by flat-headed rivets located just to the front and above their original attachment-points. The rivet for the left strap is fitted with a circular internal washer. The front and rear sections of the collar are connected to one another at the left side by an integral hinge formed of the folded ends of the top lame. The ends are in each case rounded and secured by a single, externally-flush rivet. The front and rear sections of the collar are fastened to one another at the right side by a modern, mushroom-shaped stud with a circular internal washer riveted to the third rear lame engaging a keyhole-slot in the corresponding front lame, and a modern, plain, circular stud riveted to a tongue-like projection of the first rear lame engaging a circular hole in the corresponding front lame. The front and rear sections of the collar are now rigidly secured to one another at the left side by a modern rivet with a flattened round head that occupies construction-holes in the third lames, corresponding in position to the mushroom-shaped stud and keyhole-slot at the right side of those lames.
