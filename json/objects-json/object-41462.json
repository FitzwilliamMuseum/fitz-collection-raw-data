The girl stands barefooted with her right foot slightly forward, and her head turned to her left. She holds a basket of flowers in her left hand in front of her and with her right holds up her apron, also filled with flowers. She has brown hair on which is a black ribbon at the back and a small bunch of flowers at the front. She wears a black ribbon with a four-petalled black flower round her neck, a blue bodice with white sleeves and blue bows at the elbows. The back of her skirt is yellow with a black border round the hem, and the front is white strewn with puce flowers, over which she has a white apron. The top of the base is decorated with two applied flowers, each with three leaves, and slight puce scrolls round the front edge."]
