Woodcut with hand colouring on pasteboard. A double-ended court card with a decorative strip dividing the two ends. The Jack wears a roundlet-style hat coloured in black and yellow and holds a pike in his hand. The French suit mark of diamonds is printed to the left of the King's head. The back is printed with a pattern of dots and half circles with dots at the centre in blue ink. A stamp found on the Jack of Hearts is closely comparable to that of the tax stamp of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (Naples and Sicily) circa 1830, suggesting that the cards were probably printed in France for use in Naples/Sicily, as packs were stamped in the country of use, not in the country of production."]
