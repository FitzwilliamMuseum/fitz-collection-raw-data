Sticks of pierced, carved and painted ivory, backed with mother-of-pearl; guards of pierced, carved and painted ivory backed with mother of pearl and puce foil, and decorated with applied, painted chips of mother-of-pearl.  Rivet set with clear pastes.  Front:  A painter in renaissance dress is sitting in front of an easel portraying a woman sitting in classical dress on the right.  Behind her stand two roman soldiers and a boy with a shield, and behind a wall and a column another soldier.  On the left, behind the painter, two people, a greyhound and a soldier are watching the artist.  There is a column on the left and a pedestal in the background.  Blue dominates the scene.  Left and bottom border are of a red-green line and the top edging is of gold foil.  Back:  A woman in contemporary dress is sitting on a rock, looking in a mirror; there are two little trees in the foreground.  Left and bottom borders are of a red-green line.  Sticks:  Four rococo cartouches, each enclosing a sitting woman in contemporary dress and a standing man playing the flute.  Free spaces are decorated with coloured, pierced patterns and on the bottom there are garlands of flowers.  Reverse:  the patterns and scrolls are drawn in ink and parts of the couple have been copied in the cartouches, which have a gold border.  Guards:  both guards are decorated in a similar way with alternating scrolls and flowers on the shoulder and the guard proper, and a putto above a bagpipe player on the top.  The sticks show an interesting pattern on the side when the fan is closed."]
