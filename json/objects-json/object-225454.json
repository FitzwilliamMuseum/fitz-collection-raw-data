Head and shoulders portrait of a middle-aged man, facing the viewer, with natural, wavy, shoulder-length hair, wearing a coat with collar open to the neck and neck-tie. Signed and dated on the plate at centre left with scratched letters: 'JH f / 1755'. The sheet is cut to the platemark and laid down on a secondary support of laid paper, which is inscribed in pen and ink and underlined at lower centre: '1755. / AN OYSTER MAN AT CAMBRIDGE, CALLED OLD COE. / ETCHING BY MR JOHN HOLLAND OF PETERHOUSE'. Inscribed in a curator's hand, seen elsewhere on the verso of the artist's board onto which many of the 'Cambridge Amateur' prints are laid down, apparently a transcription of the verso of the print: 'This man was many years _an / Oyster Man at Cambridge_; where / he used to attend at Queen's, Benet, / & Peter House - I knew him personally / at the last College (where he was call'd / Old* Coe) from the year _1755_ till I left / the University - this _etching_ was done / by Mr John Holland of Peter-House / & is very like the man  --- J.B. / *or Cole / His real name was _Hughes_ / (in pencil later)'."]
