Scratched lettered title, artist's monogram and date at lower centre and lower right: 'John Frederick Bryant'; 'JG 1786'. This design was used as the frontispiece to the second edition of Bryant's collection of poems, _Verses by John Frederick Bryant, late Tobacco-Pipe Maker at Bristol [...]_ (1787). The British Museum holds an earlier state of this etching, 1850,1014.398, which was used as the frontispiece to the first edition of Bryant's _Verses_, which was published earlier the same year. The second state has more tone in the areas of the eyes, mouth and left shoulder, although still retains the scratched lettering along the lower margin, possibly as an intentional informality appropriate to the sitter. The later state is unlisted in O'Donoghue."]
