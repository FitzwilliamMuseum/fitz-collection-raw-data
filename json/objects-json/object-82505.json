He faces the front, holds a yellow staff in his left hand, and places his right on his waist.  He has grey hair, moustache, eyebrows and eyes, and a red mouth, which is wide open. He wears a tall pale greyish-blue hat with red underside to the brim, and a black scarf round the crown to which is attached a bunch of white and red feathers. He has a peasecod double with a pale yellow ground and purple floral pattern, except for a strip down the centre front which has a harlequin pattern and purple buttons. On his right shoulder there are yellow, pink, red, and turquoise tabs, and on the left shoulder, pink, red, and yellow ones. His trunk hose are pink and his shoes black with reserved white buckles.
