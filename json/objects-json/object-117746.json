The front of the leaf is decorated with a classical scene set in a landscape with an urn on a pedestal at the left, and arrangements of flowers and foliage at the extreme right and left. A woman with two female attendants standing beside the pedestal, greets a man wearing a laurel wreath and holding a rolled up scroll in his left hand. An attendant stands behind him to the left, and on the right is a woman and an old man kneeling on the ground, holding a rolled scroll in his left hand and stretching out his left towards the man. The reverse has a chinoiserie scene showing a small boy taking a teapot and cup on a tray to a Chinese lady holding a screen fan, who sits on the left of him. On either side of the figures there are shrubs with black stems and pink flowers. The sticks are carved in the centre with a shaped cartouche carved with two seated figures on the left, and an uncarved area on the right (two sticks may be replacements). On each side there are two differently shaped cartouches, one containing a pair of seated putti, and another cotaining a swan or goose with a background of pierced foliage. The guards are both carved with a figure holding a fan, and on the lower part with a pierced motif of a small Chinese building"]
