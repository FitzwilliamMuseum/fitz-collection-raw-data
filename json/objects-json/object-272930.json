He matriculated at Magdalene College 1919; BA 1922; MA 1925.  He died Dec. 1995?   He was author of the standard reference A Bibliographical Dictionary of Wax Modellers (Oxford, 1973), with Supplements I-III (London, 1981-86), and a friend of the former Keeper of Coins and Medals, Graham Pollard, who gave advice during the preparation of these volumes -- the bequest is a recognition of this.  Mr Pyke bequeathed his collection of some 75 wax portraits (other than those with royal subjects, which were offered to the Queen for the Royal Collection at Windsor) to the V&A (with the 'express wish' that they display them as one collection), otherwise to the Fitzwilliam (with same wish), otherwise to be divided between the two institutions, otherwise they would fall into the residue.  The executor/solicitor did not regard the clause about display as a binding condition, and the residuary legatee has waived any residuary interest in the collection.  The Fitzwilliam Museum and the V&A agreed on the division of the collection, whereby 35 waxes came to the Fitzwilliam, of which 11 were assigned to the Department of Applied Arts and the following 24 to the Department of Coins and Medals.  A display of the Pyke bequest to the Fitzwilliam was mounted in the Museum 22 July 1997 to 25 January 1998."]
