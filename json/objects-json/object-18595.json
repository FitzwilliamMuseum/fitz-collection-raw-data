        "value": ["Breastplate, for medium or light field use. Formed in one piece, in the `peascod' fashion.  The neck and arm-openings have roped inward turns accompanied by shallow, recessed borders.  The border at the neck descends as a V-shaped projection at its centre.  The turn at the left arm-opening is damaged just below its centre.  Pierced at each shoulder is a rivet-hole for the attachment of a shoulder-strap.  The hole is now occupied by a modern round-headed rivet.  A similar rivet with a square, external washer, occupying a later hole pierced just above it, retains a modern strap and double-ended, tongued, iron buckle with simple filed decoration.  The lower edge of the breastplate is flanged outwards to receive a skirt.  The flange is pierced at either end with a rivet-hole for the attachment of the skirt.  The left hole is occupied by a later rivet with a flat, internal head.  The centre of the flange is cusped and pierced with a further rivet-hole, possibly for an internal connecting leather that ran down the centre of the skirt.  Riveted about two-thirds of the way along each side of the flange is a modern hook, formed of a strip of sheet metal, probably intended to support a belt.  A hole, now plugged by a modern, externally flush rivet, is pierced at either side of the chest.  The hole was probably intended to receive a pierced stud to engage a shoulder-strap in the seventeenth century fashion, suggesting that the breastplate had an extended working life. Together with the backplate HEN.M.117B-1933"]
