Its upper corners are cut away in shallow, concave curves.  Its sides have large, semi-circular cut-outs for the eyes with strongly flanged edges.  Its centrally-cusped lower edge is also flanged outwards and decorated with a recessed border that widens towards its centre.  Its upper edge is boxed inwards in an inverted, u-shaped curve.  A pair of rivet-holes is pierced at the centre of the upper edge for the attachment of a missing, hinged poll-plate.  A further pair of holes is pierced at each side, just above the eye-openings.  A series of nineteen rivet-holes border the lower edge of the shaffron and the flanges of the eye-opening to half way up the latter.  Three rivet-holes, arranged in a horizontal line, are pierced across the brow, while another, filled with an externally-flush rivet, is pierced a short distance above the central one.  These various rivet-holes mostly served to secure a lining, but may also in several instances have served to secure separate side-plates and perhaps also an escutcheon or plume-holder."]
