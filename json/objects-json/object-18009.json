        "value": ["Backplate, for use by an harquebusier The backplate, of exceptional weight, is formed in one piece with a narrow, upward-flanged neck-opening and a flange at the waist.  Secured by four round-headed rivets at each shoulder, beneath an original scale with simple filed ornament, is a modern buff-leather shoulder-strap.  The long terminal scale of each strap, cut with three keyhole-slots to engage the mushroom-shaped studs of the breastplate, is a modern restoration.  Later holes pierced a short distance beneath the  proximal ends of each of the shoulder-straps have subsequently been plugged with rivets.  Riveted high up between the shoulder-blades is a large pierced stud with an annular head that carries a sturdy, welded ring of uncertain function.  Riveted at each side of the waist is a modern buff-leather strap forming a waist-belt.  The left strap terminates in a modern, double-ended, tongued iron buckle.  Vacant holes are pierced just to the outside of each of the rivets that attach the present straps.  The arm-openings, the neck-openings and the waist-flange have plain inward turns bordered by single incised lines.  The backplate is of a form designed for use by the harquebusier rather than the cuirassier.  From its great weight, however, it is conceivable that this particular example was intended for siege use.  The ring fitted between the shoulder-blades may have served some function in that role. Part of the composite three-quarter armour HEN.M.18A-F-1933."]
