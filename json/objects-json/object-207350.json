Representing the defeat of the British by the Maroon people. \n\nOne of a series of 10 combs telling the strory of the Jamaican Maroons. The Maroons were a rebel group comprised of several West African tribes who escaped their captors on arrival in Jamaica. Together they fought the British for 80 years, using their knowledge of the Cockpit Mountain area and clever ambush techniques. After a final battle, led by the fearless Captain Cudjoe, the Maroons cut off the ears of the vanquished British soldiers and sent them to the British Governor. This final act forced the British to sign a peace treaty with the Maroons. On the 24th February 1738 the Accompong Maroons were granted an independent state within Jamaica, where they live to this day.\nEach comb is made from 3mm aluminium and weighs 46 grams. The surface is shaped and finished by hand to a high polish and then etched with a design on the handle. Finally, each comb is plated to cutlery grade with silver and detailed with 23 ct gold leaf and shellac-based ink."]
