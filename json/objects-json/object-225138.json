      {
        "value": ["A male figure on horseback, facing left and holding a cup with a red interior in his right hand. The card is inscribed: 'AIVA' at lower left. The inscription relates to the expression, 'A HIVA' and is thought to relate to 'La Hire', the French title for the Jack of Hearts. See handwritten note (author unknown) relating to the gift: 'On the Caballo of Copas is AIVA, which is more usually A HIVA, a word that suggests the La Hire on old French cards'. The title is a characteristic of the Cadiz pattern. The Spanish term for the suit of Cups is 'Copas'. Each suit is identified by an outline frame known as 'la pinta', which distinguishes the suit without showing the whole card; the Cups have one interruption (as is seen here), the Swords two, the Clubs three, and the Coins none. 'La pinta' first appeared around the mid-17th century. Hand coloured woodcut on pasteboard. From an incomplete set, 51 of 52 playing cards (the Knight of Swords is missing) with Spanish suits in the Cadiz pattern, made in Madrid. The Ace of Coins has scrolls inscribed with the publisher's name and place of production: 'REAL FABRICA DE MADRID' and 'POR D FELIX / SOLESIO E HIJOS' (trans. 'Felix Solesio and Sons'). The Four of Coins includes a shield at the centre containing the inscription: 'NAYPES / FINISINOS / FABIRCADOS / FN MADRID / H 1801'. The Two of Cups includes the inscription: 'PARA CARACAS' [trans., 'To Caracas'], indicating that the pack was created for export to Caracas (Venezuela) and the Spanish colonies in South America. The backs of the cards are printed in blue ink with a repeated pattern of flower shapes composed of seven small dots. The British Museum holds a very similar complete pack of 52 cards which was published by Felix Solesio and Sons in 1802. See: 1896,0501.831. See Notes."]
