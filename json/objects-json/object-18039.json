Each formed of a medially-ridged, flared tubular cuff, four upward-overlapping metacarpal-plates, a shaped knuckle-plate, four scaled  finger-defences, and a hinged, scaled thumb-defence.  The cuff is closed by a riveted and overlapped join at the inside of the wrist.  Its upper edge rises to an obtuse central point at the outside, and has a file-roped inward turn accompanied by a recessed border.  The point of the right gauntlet is broken and has lost a riveted patch.  The curved upper edge of the metacarpal plates are decorated with pairs of incised lines.  The lower edges of the downward-overlapping finger-scales are decorated with V-shaped nicks at their centres, except for the terminal scales which have rounded ends and are embossed with fingernails.  Attached to the front end of the last metacarpal-plate by an external iron hinge is a thumb-defence formed of a medially-ridged, lozenge-shaped main plate and four scales matching those of the finger defences.  The finger and thumb-defences are shown by their different internal and external colour to be modern restorations. Part of the composite three-quarter armour HEN.M.19A-G-1933."]
