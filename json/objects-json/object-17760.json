        "value": ["Two pauldrons nearly forming a pair, and a vambrace for the left arm. For field use, with etched decoration. The pauldrons are each formed of seven medially-ridged lames that overlap outwards from the third which is shaped to the point of the shoulder.  The first to third lames extend inwards at the chest and the back.  The third lame is expanded downwards to the level of the sixth lame at both the front and the rear.  The expanded portions have rounded lower, inner corners and are flanged at their outer edges.  The lower inner corners are more strongly rounded at the rear than at the front.  The first to third lames are connected to one another at their front and rear ends by modern rivets.  The third to seventh lames are connected to one another by modern rivets at their rear ends, and by modern internal leathers at their front ends and centres.  The connecting-rivets of the right pauldron move within slots. Each pauldron is fitted at its apex with a modern, single-ended, tongued iron buckle to suspend it from the collar, and pierced at its lower edge with a later or later-enlarged slot to engage the turning-pin riveted to the outside of the turner of the vambrace.  The lowest lame of the pauldron is fitted at its front and rear ends, respectively, with a modern strap and buckle that fasten around the inside of the arm.\nThe vambrace is formed of a tubular turner, a tubular upper cannon, a winged bracelet couter and a tubular lower cannon.  The turner and the upper cannon are each closed by overlapped and riveted joins at their rears.  The couter is formed of three lames that overlap outwards from the third which is shaped to the point of the elbow and expands to a moderately large wing at both the front and the rear.  It completely encircles the arm and is closed by an overlapped and riveted join at the rear. The lames are connected to one another and to the upper and lower cannons by rivets at their outer ends.  The lower cannon is formed of an inner and an outer plate: the former fitting within the latter.  The plates are connected to one another at the rear by a pair of external hinges, and fastened at the front by a modern stud riveted at the front edge of the inner plate that engages a corresponding hole pierced in the front edge of the rear plate.  The main edges of both the pauldrons and the vambraces have file-roped inward turns.\nThe pauldrons and the vambrace are decorated with etched bands of interlacing foliage, trophies, masks and animals involving oval cartouches enclosing human figures, all on a blackened and partly stippled ground.  The main and subsidiary edges of the pauldrons are both decorated with etched borders of stylised acanthus foliage on a blackened and partly stippled ground.  The main bands and the borders are in every case enclosed by groups of narrower bands that are in some cases decorated with guilloche or roping.  The third lame of each pauldron is decorated at the front and rear with large oval cartouches framed by stylised acanthus foliage and enclosing human figures, and at the point of the shoulder with a pair of confronted valutes enclosing portrait busts.
