        "value": ["Collar for field of tournament use. Formed of three upward overlapping lames front and rear.  The top lame in each instance has a prominent, file-roped inward turn at its upper edge, bordered by seven externally-flush lining-rivets.  The bottom lame in each instance is considerably deeper than the rest.  The front one has an obtusely pointed lower edge, and the rear one, a straight lower edge with strongly rounded corners.  The lower edge in each instance has a file-roped inward turn.  That at the front is accompanied by eleven externally-flush lining-rivets, and that at the rear, by twelve such rivets.  The lames are connected to one another by three modern, internal leathers front and rear.  The leathers are retained by pairs of rivets which are of externally-flush form, except in the bottom lame in each instance where they are of brass with round heads and internal washers.  Modern brass-capped rivets occupy construction-holes in the second and third lames aligning with the outer of the pair of rivet-holes for the attachment of the outer leather in the underlying lames.  The front and rear sections are connected to one another at the left side by an integral hinge formed of the folded ends of the top lames.  The ends are shaped around the pairs of externally-flush rivets that retain them.  The front and rear sections of the collar are fastened to one another at the right side by a modern, brass-capped, mushroom-shaped stud riveted to the bottom rear lame engaging a keyhole-slot in the corresponding front lame, and a modern, small, plain stud riveted to a tongue-like projection of the top rear lame engaging a circular hole in the corresponding front lame.  The small plain stud was originally one of a pair.  The lower one is now missing.  The front and rear sections of the collar are now rigidly secured to one another at the left side by a modern, round-headed rivet of brass with a pentagonal internal washer that occupies construction-holes in the bottom lames, corresponding in position to the mushroom-shaped stud and key-hole slot at the right sides of those lames.  Secured by a modern, brass-capped, round-headed rivet at the top of each shoulder of the bottom lame is a brass hinge with rounded terminals, constricted sides and low-relief, punched ornament.  Riveted to the distal end of each hinge is a tall, circular stud that served to engage a hole in the upper edge of the pauldron.  The stud is pierced with a vertical slot and fitted with a riveted transverse pin that formerly served to pivot a triangular retaining-lug. Part of the composite half armour HEN.M.5A-E-1933"]
