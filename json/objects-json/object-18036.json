        "value": ["Pair of pauldrons and vambraces, for use by a cuirassier. The pauldrons are each formed of ten lames that overlap outwards from the fifth.  The first to fifth lames extend inwards over the chest and the back.  The fifth lame is expanded downwards to the level of the bottom of the seventh lame at the front, and the bottom of the eighth lame at the rear.  The expanded portions have rounded lower inner corners and are flanged outwards at their outer edges, where they overlap the lames beneath them which only extend to the inside of the arm.  The first to fifth lames are connected to one another by modern round-headed rivets with square internal washers at their rear ends and by modern internal leathers at their front ends and centres.  The fifth to tenth lames are connected to one another and the turners beneath by three internal leathers.  These are secured to each lame by a single lame, although the original leathers were secured by pairs of rivets.  The apex of the first lame is pierced with a large rectangular hole above a single-ended, tongued, iron buckle with a roller, that served to suspend the pauldron from a strap that issued from each side of a collar.\nThe vambraces are each formed of a tubular turner, a tubular upper cannon, a winged bracelet couter of five lames and a tubular lower cannon.  The turner is closed by a riveted overlap at the rear.  Its lower edge is bordered by a raised rib, the hollowed underside of which locks over and rotates on the outward-flanged upper edge of the upper cannon.  The upper cannon is closed by a riveted overlap at the rear.  Its lower edge is cut away in a concave curve at the inside of the elbow.  The couter is formed of five lames that overlap outwards from the third, which completely encircles the arm and is closed at the rear by a riveted overlap.  The third lame is shaped to the point of the elbow and expands to a large wing at both the front  and the rear.  The lames are connected to one another and to the upper and lower cannons by modern round-headed rivets with square internal washers.  The tapering lower cannon is formed of an inner and an outer plate: the former fitting within the latter.  The inner and the outer plates are connected to one another at the rear by an internal hinge secured at either end by a pair of modern round-headed rivets, and fastened at the front by a plain circular stud that is riveted to the inner plate and engages a hole in the outer plate.  The upper end of the inner plate is cut away in a concave curve to clear the inside of the elbow.  Each of the outer plates is pierced at its lower front corner with a later wiring-hole for the attachment of gauntlets.\nThe main edges of the pauldrons and vambraces have plain inward turns bordered by pairs of incised lines.  Pairs of incised lines also border the secondary edges of the pauldrons and vambraces.  The secondary edges of the pauldrons and the couters rise to low rounded cusps medially.
