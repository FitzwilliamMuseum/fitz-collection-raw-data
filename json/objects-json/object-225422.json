ANNIS . DEO . RESPONDEBITIS . ET . MIHI .' ['A hundred years hence ye shall answer to God and to me']. The medallion rests against a post from which hangs a spiked crown and a broken chain. A stake to which an anchor is tied with a rope is propped against the post. The printmaker's initials are engraved in monogram at lower left: 'JG'. On the verso is a graphite inscription relating to price: '1/' [1 shilling]. The identity of the person depicted in the portrait is almost certainly Jan Hus (1374-1415), a protestant martyr who was burned at the stake for his beliefs in 1415. Hus is said to have spoken the latin words etched around the medallion during his execution. This is possibly a copy after an existing (unidentified) print. The British Museum holds an etching of a similar subject which is titled 'Huss the Reformer', made by William Gilpin, probably c. 1760, which also features a portrait medallion with stake and anchor. See: 1871,0812.3262."]
