        "value": ["Sallet, with a movable visor, for heavy field use. Formed of a one-piece skull, a deep, pivoted visor and a laminated neck-defence.  The skull has a broad, rounded crown, and extends downwards at the sides to just above the level of the shoulders where its edge has a plain, partial, inward turn.  It has a broad, arched face-opening at the front, and an arched cut-out at the nape to receive the neck-defense.  The base of the crown is encircled by nineteen lining-rivets, of which the central one at the front is missing. The rear eight, lacking their internal washers, are round-headed, while the remainder, which sit beneath the visor, are externally flush.  A pair of lace-holes at the apex of the skull, two pairs at its rear, and a further pair at either side of the neck served to secure the lining.  Those at either side of the neck are now filled by later round-headed rivets.  At the bottom left corner of the face-opening is riveted a small, circular stud to engage a corresponding hole in the left of the visor.  The visor is attached to the skull by a pair of riveted pivots with low, slightly rounded, radially-fluted heads and octagonal internal washers.  The visor has short arms shaped around the pivots, a stepped, centrally-divided vision-slit, and is strongly embossed over the point of the chin where it is pierced with eight small ventilation-holes arranged as a triangular group of three at either side and a vertically aligned pair at the centre.  It is embossed a short distance below the vision-slit with a pronounced, transverse ridge.  The concave space between this ridge and the step of the vision-slit is pierced with six vertical ventilation-slots.  The lower edge of the visor has a plain, partial inward turn, matching and continuing that of the skull.  The same is true of the main edge of the neck-defence which is formed of four downward-overlapping lames connected to one another and the skull, respectively, by a round-headed rivet and internal washer at either side.  The last lame is longer than the rest and has a rounded end."]
