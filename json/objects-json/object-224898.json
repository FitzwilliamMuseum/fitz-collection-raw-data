        "value": ["From a complete set of 32 pasteboard playing cards without suits, intended for instruction only, on the subject of the Kings and Queens of England, from William I (1026-1087) to George II (1683-1760). The cards are all presented in the same format, with small circular medallions at upper centre containing a hand-coloured woodcut portrait of the King or Queen, accompanied by birth/death and reign dates, a summary of personal character and achievements followed by a list of the major events of the reign, all printed in letterpress. Four of the cards (Charles I, Oliver Cromwell, Charles II and James II) include along their lower edges parts of the imprint of the printer and publisher details from the printed sheet, prior to cutting and mounting, which when joined together reads: 'LONDON: Printed by T. Gillet, Salisbury Square for JOHN WALLIS at his MAP WAREHOUSE No. 16 LUDGATE STREET'. John Wallis was based at 16, Ludgate Street, London from 1783-5, and in 1790 and 1801. The verso of the cards is blank. The cards are known by the following title: 'History: Sovereigns of England. \"Historical cards exhibiting the History of England\"', which is printed onto the original pasteboard cases containing similar packs of cards in the British Museum collection. See especially an incomplete pack from the Schreiber Bequest: Playing-cards Schreiber E. 157."]
