The unglazed underside has a large circular ventilation hole in the middle, and three patch-marks. The round low mound base is decorated in relief round the edge with rocaille ‘frills’, and scrolls, and rises up at the back into a tree stump with a forward projecting branch with applied leaves and abundant small blue and yellow flowers. The huntsman stands in front of a hound lying in front of the stump. His right foot is forward, his left arm is behind his back, and his right hand is held out in front to support the barrel of his gun, the other end of which rests on the projecting branch. He has brown hair, brown eyebrows, mauve eyes, ruddy cheeks, and a red mouth. He wears a black tricorne hat, a red waistcoat profusely gilded with flowers and foliage down the front, a turquoise jacket with fur lining and trimming, mauve breeches with gilded foliage on the front, white gaiters with black buttons, and black shoes. A pale purple flask is slung on his right side by a darker purple strap over his left shoulder. The hound has floppy ears, and reddish-brown markings. Behind it there is a small clump of blue and yellow flowers and a few leaves. Between the man’s feet there are three pink and yellow flowers, and another beside his left foot. The edge of the base is picked out in mauve, green, and gold. \nA pair with EC.17B-1938"]
