Formed of a skull with an integral neck-defence, a pivoted peak with a separate face-defence, and a bevor with an integral neck-defence, attached to the skull by the same pivots as the peak.  The rounded skull is formed in two halves joined by a turn to the right along a low medial comb.  The slightly downturned, medially-ridged peak projects forward to an acute central point which shows slight damage.  Riveted within the brow of the peak is a medially-ridged, U-shaped face-defence which is cut with a pair of large eye-openings of inverted tear-drop shape, and a small lozenge-shaped ventilation-hole at the mouth.  The face-defence is secured to the bevor at the right side of the chin by a swivel-hook and pierced stud.  The main edges of the helmet have plain inward turns accompanied by recessed borders.\nThe helmet is painted overall with a continuous pattern of scrolling gold foliage on a blackened ground.  The painting was applied to the helmet subsequent to manufacture, possibly for pageant use."]
