From this figure rises a stem which branches out forming twenty-nine small roundels in the manner of a Tree of Jesse. Of these small roundels, nineteen contain half-length figures holding scrolls, two of whom wear crowns and several are bearded. The four half-length figures in the uppermost rows on the left and the six  in the uppermost rows on the right hold books and are all bearded. In the large central roundel at the top, seated on an elaborate throne, Christ, turned and slightly facing left, holds out a crown in each hand; an open book rest upright in his lap. On either side in smaller roundels are the Virgin and St John, forming the 'Deisis'. Below in the centre of the icon are two large roundels: the one on the left containing St George on horse-back slaying the Dragon, and that on the right containing St Theodor Stratilatus on horse-back slaying an enemy. The small figure riding behind St George is the servant who, according to legend, carrying a cup of wine refreshed the saint with it in the middle of the fray: the small figure on the right is the Princess he rescued. The bearded figure riding behind St Theodor is a monk holding a rosary - also a legendary motif."]
