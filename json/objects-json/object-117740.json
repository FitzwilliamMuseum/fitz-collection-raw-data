Sticks of cut and painted ivory pierced with applications of straw; guards of carved, pierced, cut and painted ivory with mother-of-pearl backing and applications of straw (20+2) Rivet of iron and washer of mother-of-pearl.  Front: five scenes in cartouches bordered by scrolling gold frames on a pale blue background with sprays of roses and blue and pink stripes.  The central scene has two women, one sitting, the other standing holding a hulot and a man kneeling on the right in front of a basket of flowers; in the background is an urn on a pedestal, trees and bushes, people and a building on the left, water and buildings on the right.  In the extreme left cartouche is a shepherd sitting under a tree with a woman, his dog, a flock of sheep and a building to the left.  The next cartouche shows a woman sitting on a bank under trees, a standing man, a man in a small boat and two houses in the background.  In the cartouche on the extreme right, a woman is sitting in front of a drape hanging on a tree and a shepherd who is offering her a lamb; in the background a village and people working in a field and fishing.  In the last cartouche, a shepherd, with his dog, is sitting on a bank playing a pipe; in the background two people in a boat and a village can be seen.  The top is edged with gold paper, the left border painted with a gold line.  Back:  One scene with a woman sitting in front of a group of trees in the centre and a man playing the bagpipes, two women sitting on the ground with a basket of flowers; in the background one can see houses and trees.  Sticks:  there are two different designs placed in pairs.  One design has a rectangular plate with applied square straw pieces flanked by blue, brown and gold dotted S-shapes.  Two sticks of the other design form a flower flanked by the same wavy ornaments.  Reverse undecorated.  Guards:   Both guards are decorated in a similar way.  The head has raindrop-shaped pierced holes, which, together with the pierced holes in the stick, form a window when the fan is closed.  The guard proper has diagonal stripes of applied straw squares alternating with flowers, a bagpipe and foliage."]
