The 'frame' is decorated with a chromolithographed flower scrap with green cut-paper leaves mounted at upper centre and at lower centre, a chromolithographed heart with flowers and cherub with 'LOVE' printed above. An embossed, chromolithographed wreath of ivy leaves is mounted on paper springs (now stuck down at the left side) at the centre and contains a rice-paper blind (damaged) mounted with a bunch of fabric forget-me-nots tied with a gold metallic bow. The front paper is adhered to the back paper. An oval medallion with gold printed border and chromolithograph of a winged Cupid sitting on the ground, is pasted to the album leaf below. A hand-written inscription in graphite on the album leaf above: '1867', which is probably a transcription of a date found on the verso of the valentine prior to mounting into the album. The hand is recognisable as that of Miss Catherine Parsons and is seen in other albums throughout the collection, documenting and transcribing inscriptions, prices and maker's names. Catherine Parsons was a close friend of Glaisher towards the end of his life and undertook to arrange and mount his valentine collection into albums from the Autumn of 1924 through to the Summer of the following year and beyond."]
