        "value": ["A hand-coloured etching and engraving on pasteboard of a druidic-type figure with a long white beard, dressed in a long brown robe with a hood and wearing sandals on his feet. The figure holds a long white staff in his left hand and a golden ball in his right. A mountainous landscape with a path through crags is seen in the background. The figure represents Merlin, 'the magic prophet, cabinet counsellor to Vortigern, Aurelius Ambrosius, Uter Pendragon, father to King Arthur, and King Arthur who was his pupil, knight of Scotland', as described in the Baker & Co. pamphlet that was published with the cards, see below. A large yellow diamond, sub-divided into four, at upper right. The diamond suit is here styled as a lozenge which references the Argyle pattern derived from Scottish Clan Campbell of Argyll. The card is untitled. From a pack of 52 playing cards which employs fanciful suits based on French and German models themed according to the countries of the United Kingdom: England (Acorns), Scotland (Diamonds), Wales (Spades) and Ireland (Hearts). The British Museum has a set of these cards (1848,1209.296-349) which includes an uncoloured title-card printed with the publisher's details as follows: 'Baker & Co's Eclectic Cards. For England, Ireland, Scotland & Wales. Sold Wholesale and Retail at their Manufactory, No. 2 King Arthur or New Card Court, York Street, Black Friar's Road, London. N.B. To be had of all Respectable Stationers in the United Kingdom'. This pack is also accompanied by a twelve-page printed pamphlet which gives, 'A short account of Baker and Co.'s Complete, Grand, Historical, Eclectic Cards, for England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, being a selection or an Eclectic Company of Twelve of the most eminent personages that ever distinguished themselves in those respective countries for Heroic Deeds, Wisdom, &c.', and which was printed by Theodore Page, Black Friar's Road in 1813."]
