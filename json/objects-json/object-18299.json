Formed in one piece with an almond-shaped crown that curves down at each side and rises to a short, backward-directed 'stalk' at its apex; and an integral brim that is turned down at each side and curves up to a point at the front and rear.  The edge of the brim has a file-roped inward turn accompanied by a narrow, recessed border.  The base of the skull was originally encircled by fourteen brass-capped, round-headed rivets with circular, internal washers.  One of these rivets is now missing from the left side, and two from the right side.  The central rivet on the left side retains a fragment of a leather strap for attaching a missing cheek-piece.  Attached at the nape by a pair of brass-capped, round-headed rivets is a modern brass plume-holder with seven radiating arms, of which the top two and the bottom ones have outward-scrolled ends decorated with filed lines.  The brass cap of the right retaining-rivet is missing.\nThe crown of the helmet is decorated on each side with a central urn surrounded by classical figures, herms, exotic birds, and human and animal-headed scrolls in the mannerist fashion, all etched and gilt on a blackened ground.  It is further decorated at its apex with stylised acanthus foliage, along its medial ridge with a pair of narrow bands, and around its base with a single narrow band, all etched and gilt.  The brim of the helmet is decorated with trophies and dolphins involving cartouches enclosing masks and winged cherubs' heads, all etched and gilt."]
