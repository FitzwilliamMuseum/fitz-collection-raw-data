I know the Leicester Galleries catalogued the drawing as 'Rossetti / and the young Swinburne', but that was in 1957, after Max was dead and they / simply made a bad guess. // From time to time the Leicester Galleries used to send Max a list of / drawings sold and unsold, and from these lists I noted a few titles which / were new to me. Among them was one saying: 'S.H. vainly endeavouring to enlist / D.G.R.'s interest in some singularly interesting experiment'. I have no doubt / that S.H. stands for Sylvester Hethway, the dullard who had known Rossetti and other famous men but haf nothing new or interesting to say about any of them, (see Max's broadcast 'Hethway Speaking' in the 1957 edition of Mainly on the Air). / Your drawing seems to me to fit this title completely and I hope you'll agree. / Yours ever / Rupert"]
