Formed in one piece with a rounded crown that curves down at each side and rises to a high, roped medial comb; and an integral brim that is turned down at each side and curves up to a point at the front and rear.  The edge of the brim has a file-roped inward turn accompanied by a narrow, recessed border.  The comb is decorated with a single incised line at its crest, and a pair of incised lines at its base.  The base of the skull was originally encircled by fourteen round-headed lining-rivets with brass, rosette washers.  The second from near rivet on the left side is now missing.  The two rivets in front of it have been replaced by ones with flat internal heads that retain fragments of the leathers for the attachment of missing cheek-pieces.  In the course of replacing these two rivets, their rosette washers have become damaged.  The two corresponding rivets on the right side also retain fragments of leathers for the attachment of missing cheek-pieces.  These rivets are fitted with square, internal washers.  Three of the other surviving rivets are fitted with circular or octagonal internal washers.  The two central rivets at the left side retain a fragment of the original linen lining-band.  A pair of rivet-holes pierced at the nape, just above the level of the lining-rivets, served to attach a missing plume-holder.\nThe helmet has suffered slight denting or deformation towards the rear of the crest of its comb, and at the front, rear and left side of its brim."]
