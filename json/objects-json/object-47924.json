It has a circular ventilation hole at the back below the tree stump. the high D-shaped mound base is moulded at the front with a C-scroll and rocaille 'frilling'. It rises up at the back into a tree stump with lateral branches bearing applied flowers and leaves.  The shepherd stands in front of the stump on his right leg with his left leg advanced. He has a bagpipe under his left arm, and holds its pipe in both hands. He has brown hair tied back with a yellow bow, and wears a green hat with a yellow underside to the brim, and a purple ribbon round the crown. The left side of the brim is turned up and held by a gold clasp. He has a dark pink coat with pale orange lining and gold buttons, a yellow waistcoat with a striped brown and orange border, orange and white striped breeches with a purple bow on each knee, white stockings, and yellow shoes with purple bows. A dog lies at his feet looking up towards him. It is white with reddish-brown patches, and a black collar. The applied flowers are painted in yellow and purple, orange-red, yellow, and dark pink, with green leaves. The moulding across the front of the base is picked out in pink, a little turquoise, and gold."]
