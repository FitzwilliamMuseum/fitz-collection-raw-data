From an incomplete pack, 38 of 40 playing cards of a stripped Spanish deck in the Cadiz pattern, made in Madrid in 1892 by Felix Solesio & Sons. The 8 and 9 cards are missing in all suits, indicating the stripped deck, and additionally the Jack of Clubs and the Five of Clubs are lost. The Spanish term for the suit of Coins is 'Copas'. Each suit is identified by an outline frame known as 'la pinta', which distinguishes the suit without showing the whole card; the Cups have one interruption (as is seen here), the Swords two, the Clubs three, and the Coins none. 'La pinta' first appeared around the mid-17th century. The backs of the cards are printed in blue ink with a repeated pattern of star shapes composed of eight small dots with an isolated dot separating each star."]
