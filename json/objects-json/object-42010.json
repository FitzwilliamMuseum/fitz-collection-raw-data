The square base has four scroll feet with a rocaille motif pierced by a heart between the two feet at the front. The underside of each foot is unglazed. The figure is supported at the back by a tree stump with on each side, a low Y-shaped branch bearing two flowers and leaves. At centre back below the figure, there is a square aperture to take an attachment. Columbine stands on her left foot with her right foot forward, resting between two applied yellow flowers on the base. Her head is tilted to her left, her right hand is raised to touch her hat, and her left arm is extended in front of her holding the end of a slap stick which rests on her left hip. She wears a yellow broad-brimmed hat with a pink underside and gold scalloped edge, and has a pink ruffle round her neck. The back of her bodice is half pink and half yellow; the front blue, and the pink and yellow sleeves are decorated with playing cards. Her full skirt is decorated with sprays of polychrome flowers and foliage on the front, and with scrolls and playing cards on the back. Its lower edge has a pinkish-red painted flounce.  The two flowers on the viewer's right of the tree are blue and pink, and those on the left are yellow and blue. The base is picked out in pale green and two shades of purple."]
