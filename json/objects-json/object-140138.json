The low rounded triangular  base has a tree stump at the back, and its top is strewn with applied leaves, two yellow roses, and two blue flowers. The Pandur stands on his left leg with his right advanced and slightly to the side. His left shoulder is forward and he looks towards his left.  His left hand rests on his belt, and he grasps a scimitar in his right hand which is extended a little behind him. He has a black moustache, and black short hair, covered by a fur-trimmed, yellow bag-shaped cap. He wears a white coat with blue cuffs and gold buttons, red breeches, and red sandals. A musket is slung across his back by means of a brown strap across his chest. A cream bag hangs on his right side from a black belt, and a scabbard for a dagger on the left. Two brown and grey pistols are attached to the belt at centre front, and a sword in a gold and white scabbard is suspended at his left side by means of a cream strap which passes over his right shoulder."]
