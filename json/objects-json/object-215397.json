      {
        "value": ["A semi-matt bromide print of a collection of urns and statuary outside a 19th-century brick-built house of at least two storeys. The focus of the group is a statue of Bacchus holding a buch of grapes in his right hand, head slightly bowed and draped in a tasselled cloth which is wrapped around his torso. A stump with grapevine entwined around it is to his left. The sculpture of a gun dog stands on the ground to the left. The Bacchus statue is closely comparable to a statue of Bacchus in the grounds of Emo Court in County Laois, Ireland, although the brick building behind is unlike the stone facade of Emo Court. It is not clear why this photograph is contained within this album as the hand-written additions of dates onto the album leaves (almost certainly written by Catherine Parsons) indicate that the valentines were probably mounted into it rather than it being the case that the album was bought already complete at auction. However, it could have been bought as part of a lot at auction and then included in the album. There is a connection between Bacchus and valentines in that the children of Bacchus were Priapus (god of fertility) and Hymen (god of marriage). Grape vines also sometimes feature in the embossed paper designs of valentines. Miss Catherine Parsons was a close friend of Glaisher towards the end of his life and undertook to arrange and mount Glaisher's valentines into albums from the Autumn of 1924 into the Summer of the following year and beyond."]
