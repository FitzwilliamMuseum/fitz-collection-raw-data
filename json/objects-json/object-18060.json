        "value": ["Gauntlet for the right hand, of fingered form, for light field use without a vambrace. Formed of a long, flared cuff, five metacarpal plates, a knuckle-plate, a finger-plate, four scaled finger-defences and a hinged, scaled thumb-defence.  The cuff is formed of an outer plate and a considerably shorter inner plate.  The latter is riveted within the former.  The outer plate is medially-ridged and rises at its upper edge to a pronounced central point.  The upper edge of the cuff has a file-roped inward turn accompanied by a recessed border containing eleven lining-rivets.  A twelfth lining-rivet is lost from the apex of the outer plate.  The lower edge of the inner plate has a plain inward turn.  Riveted within each side of the lower end of the outer plate is a leather strap to fasten the gauntlet around the inside of the wrist.  The shorter front strap, which terminates in a single-ended tongued iron buckle, is broken.  The lower edge of the outer plate is overlapped by a series of five medially-ridged, upward-overlapping lames that are decorated with V-shaped nicks at their centres.  The lowest metacarpal-plate is overlapped by a knuckle-plate decorated with a file-roped transverse rib of boxed form.  The lower edge of the knuckle-plate overlaps a finger-plate which is shaped to the fingers.  The cuff, the metacarpal-plates, the knuckle-plate and the finger-plate are connected to one another at their outer ends by round-headed rivets with circular internal washers.  Riveted within the finger-plate are four finger-defences formed of between six and seven medially-ridged scales riveted to underlying leather strips.  The last two scales of the first finger-defence are rigidly riveted to one another to compensate for the loss of the leathers at that point.  Attached by a hinge to the front edge of the gauntlet is a thumb-defence of four medially-ridged, downward-overlapping scales.  The hinge is secured to the gauntlet by the rivet that connects the fourth and fifth metacarpal-plates to one another.  The upper scale of the main-plate of the thumb defence is of lozenge-shaped form with a notched upper end and a truncated lower end.  The thumb-defence is probably restored. Part of the composite armour HEN.M.20A-H-1933."]
