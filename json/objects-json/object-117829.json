Rivet of brass; washer of mother-of-pearl.  Front:  in the centre, in front of a rock, a woman is sitting on the ground with an open book of music on her lap; behind her a standing couple, to her right a man with a stick and a woman sitting on the ground.  On the left, under a tree, sits a shepherdess with sheep being courted by a young man.  On the right, next to a pedestal a sitting couple and a young woman pulling down flowers on the pedestal are worked.  There is a stream in the foreground with two sheep lying on the bank.  Scrolling gold foliage and flowers on a dark ground flanks the scene.  The top edging is of gold foil and scrolls; the lower border has a gold line.  Back:  a couple is sitting under a tree, two wreaths above the woman's head, children are playing in the foreground on a bank and people are dancing in the background on the left.  There is a building in the background on the right, partly covered by forest.  The scene is bordered by scrolling foliage on the top.  Sticks:  The sticks are decorated with horizontal, vertical and diagonal stripes and there are five symmetrically set cartouches with flowers; the first and last sticks are applied with gold foil.  Guards:  Both guards are decorated in a similar way; there are leaf shapes on the shoulder, flowers and zigzag patterns on the guard proper."]
