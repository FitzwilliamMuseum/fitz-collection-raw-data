A further hand-written inscription in blue crayon: '8'. The envelope once contained a series of 8 small 48mo playing-card-style comic valentines from a series featuring men with flowers or as hybrid flowers, six of which are mounted on the same leaf in album P.14412-R, nos. 86-91. Two additional cards which were originally mounted on this leaf of the album were presumably also included in the envelope. See P.14374-R and P.14361-R. The envelope probably originated with a dealer who was sending Glaisher valentines on approval. A ninth card, from the same series is mounted on the facing leaf of the album and is assumed not to have been one of the eight contained in the envelope. See also P.14412-R-L8, an identical envelope with an inscription in the same hand and which contained a number of valentines from a different series."]
