The circular mound base has three lobes at the front, and has a glazed concave underside with a circular ventilation hole near the back. The top is decorated with rocaille scrolls and four applied flowers and leaves. The figure is supported by a tree stump with a branch on each side bearing applied flowers and leaves. At its base at the back there is a square aperture to take an attachment, probably a candle branch. The girl stands with her feet slightly apart, her head turned to her left, and her arms bent at the elbows, holding a triangle in her right hand, in her left a now missing stick. On her head she has a red and a puce feather, and an orange-red flower attached to a flowing yellow streamer, and round her neck, a puce necklace with a small cross pendant. She wears a white chemise with elbow length sleeves under a puce bodice with a basque, and three blue pompoms down the stomacher, a blue and puce striped petticoat with gilt ornament, and a pink skirt at the back, and yellow overskirt which is hitched up all round. Her shoes are yellow with a small yellow buckle. The tree has two dark puce, a yellow, and an orange flower. The top of the base is picked out in turquoise, green, and gold."]
