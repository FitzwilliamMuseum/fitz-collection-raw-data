The arm-openings and the neck-opening have file-roped inward  turns bordered by single incised lines.  The incised line around the neck-opening projects downwards as a narrow chevron at its centre.  The backplate is decorated with three pairs of incised lines that diverge from its waist to the centres of its neck and arm-openings.  A modern shoulder-strap is riveted at each shoulder.  Modern single-ended tongued iron buckles have been incorrectly riveted beneath each armpit to connect the backplate to a breastplate.  A pair of holes are pierced at each side of the waist for the attachment of a missing waist-belt.  A later bolt of uncertain function protrudes internally from the centre of the waist-flange.  Attached by a modern round-headed screw and square nut at each side of the waist-flange is an associated skirt formed of two plates joined medially by an internal hinge.  The skirt is transversely boxed and decorated with a file-roped rib along the angle of the boxing.  Each side of the skirt is pierced near its upper edge with a horizontal slot that would originally have served to suspend it from pierced rectangular studs projecting from the waist-flange of the backplate.  The upper edge of the skirt is decorated with a single incised. line.  A double-ended tongued iron buckle of  uncertain function is riveted at each side of the lower edge of the skirt.  Pairs of leathering-rivets at the lower edge of the skirt show that it would originally have been extended downwards by one or more lames. Part of the composite armour HEN.M.20A-H-1933."]
