The common Sewer makes a circular turn close around this Angle. / All the Tesserae are of burnt Clay, except the Purple and Green of the Drapery about the Bacchus which are of Glass.  The / Brick, Lime and Pebbles, under which was a very deep bed of Loam on Virgin earth.  Part of a human Jaw bone containing two of the / Teeth, together with the Bones of a Finger, were found immediately under the Angle of the Southwest Border, with some Fragments / of Pottery, apparently Part of an Urn. / Great Pains have been taken to render an accurate Copy, preserving the due tint of it's / Colours, and shewing the Form and Manner of place the Tesserae.
