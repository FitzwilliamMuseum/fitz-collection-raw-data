        "value": ["PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION: Album with grey cloth covers and dark green leaves. 'ALBUM' stamped in brown ink within an Art Nouveau-style (circa 1890-1918) medallion at the centre of the front cover. Graphite inscriptions at the upper left corner of the front pastedown: '?9 /-' [?9 shillings]; '3/11' ; '143'. Glaisher's bookplate is affixed at the centre of the front pastedown. [Etched bookplate printed in brown ink featuring the above text inside a scroll bordered by acanthus leaves. Two shields above featuring the Cambridge University coat of arms and Trinity College coat of arms, entwined with acanthus leaves; three pottery vessels below of which the central, multi-handled tyg is sprouting acanthus leaves. \"G. W. Eve f.\" at lower left. The bookplate is thought to have been commissioned about 1907. Julia Poole has identified the pottery featured in the book plate as representing three of the major types of pottery in Glaisher's collection. They are, from left to right: an English delftware posset pot, an Wrotham slipware tyg and a Delft vase in Oriental style. See Julia Poole, _James Whitbread Lee Glaisher ScD, FRS (1848-1928) Mathematician and Collector_ (exhibition catalogue, Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, 12 January-18 April, 1999), Case 1, Bookplate of J.W.L. Glaisher, p. 6. The central Wrotham slipware tyg is additionally inscribed with several mathematical symbols. Glaisher described these to Miss Catherine Parsons in response to a discussion they are having about book plates. See Fitzwilliam Museum, MS 864-1985, 6th September, 1923, letter to Miss Catherine Parsons.] One of 13 albums bound with grey cloth covers and brown Art Nouveau-style stamped title design. The binding of this album has not been waxed and the end papers and leaves are dark green rather than dark brown, as in the others. This album was probably made by J.W. & Co. Ltd., as others with the same binding are identified in an imprint on the front pastedown as 'photo scrap albums' from the ' \"Bedford\" Series' by J.W. & Co. Ltd.. CONTENTS: Contains the majority of lithographic designs for valentines by Edward Gilks from Glaisher's collection."]
