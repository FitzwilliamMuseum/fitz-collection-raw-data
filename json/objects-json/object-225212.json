        "value": ["Seven clubs with circular nodules. The seventh positioned horizontally. The card is unnumbered. The Spanish term for the suit of Clubs is 'Bastos'. The standing kings are typical of Spanish card design. The Kings in Italian suits are seated. The clubs in Spanish suits are 'rough' (knobbly) and in the Cadiz pattern are characterised by circular nodules and the long branches which extend from the Ace of Clubs. Each suit is identified by an outline frame known as 'la pinta', which distinguishes the suit without showing the whole card; the Cups have one interruption, the Swords two, the Clubs three (as is seen here), and the Coins none. 'La pinta' first appeared around the mid-17th century. Hand coloured woodcut on pasteboard. From an incomplete pack, 38 of 40 playing cards of a stripped Spanish deck in the Cadiz pattern, made in Madrid in 1892 by Felix Solesio & Sons. The 8 and 9 cards are missing in all suits, indicating the stripped deck, and additionally the Jack of Clubs and the Five of Clubs are lost."]
