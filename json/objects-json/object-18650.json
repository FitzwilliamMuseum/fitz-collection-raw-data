Formed of a moderately long, tubular cuff, three downward-overlapping wrist-plates, five upward-overlapping metacarpal plates, a shaped knuckle-plate, four scaled finger-defences and a hinged, scaled thumb-defence.  The cuff is closed at the inside by an overlapped and riveted join.  Its straight upper edge has a plain inward turn bordered by small stitching-holes.  The inside of the cuff is crudely pierced with a large suspension-hole.  The cuff, the wrist-plates and the metacarpal-plates are connected to one another at each side by sliding-rivets.  The finger-scales overlap upwards whereas the thumb-scales overlap downwards.  The knuckle-plate, the finger-defences and the thumb-defence are restored.  The upper edge of the cuff is bordered by a pair of incised lines and further in with five incised lines.  The lower edges of the cuff and the wrist-plates, and upper edges of the metacarpal-plates are decorated with pairs of incised lines.  The wrist-plate is decorated internally with five transverse incised lines, suggesting that it has been turned inside-out."]
