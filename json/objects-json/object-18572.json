        "value": ["Backplate, of munition quality, for infantry use. Formed of a main plate, a pair of side-plates, and a later-associated waist-plate.  The shallow neck and arm-openings have plain inward turns accompanied by recessed borders.  The lower edges of the main plate and side-plates also have plain inward turns.  The lateral edges of the main plate diverge upwards and outwards to bisect the arm-openings.  They overlap the inner edges of the side-plates and are secured to them by six rivets in each case.  Those on the left are externally flush, while those on the right are round-headed and replaced.  A rivet-hole for the attachment of a shoulder-strap is pierced at each shoulder.  A later hole is pierced a short distance below that on the right, and a longer distance below that on the left.  The main plate is decorated with two pairs of flutes that diverge upwards and outwards from the small of the back towards the shoulders.  The outer ends of the side-plates are each pierced a short distance above the waist with a rivet-hole for the attachment of a waist-belt.  Above each of these holes, a little below the armpit, is pierced a later rivet-hole.  A later wiring-hole is pierced at the rear corner of each arm-opening.  The lower part of the lateral edge of the left side-plate is cut with a long, shallow notch.  The lower edge of each side-plate is decorated with three modern round-headed rivets, and the centre of the lower edge of the 'central' plate with two.  Fitted within the lower edge of the main and side-plates is a waist-plate which is strongly boxed outwards at its lower edge.  It is retained by three flat-headed rivets: one at the centre of the main plate, and another at the outer end of each of the side-plates.  The lower edge of the waist-plate is pierced at either end and at the centre with rivet-holes, and at the extreme right end with a wiring-hole.  Wiring-holes are also pierced mid-way down each side of the waist-plate."]
