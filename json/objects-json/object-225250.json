        "value": ["Lithograph (uncoloured) on white wove paper. Inlaid within a frame of buff wove paper (approx. height 360mm x width 515mm). Wellington and Peel (viewed from behind) try to prevent a bearded figure characterised as a Jew from entering a doorway at the far right. The bearded figure says (printed speech inside a speech bubble at upper centre): 'Pray let me in! I am sure I shall / Behave myself, as well as some, / whom you have admitted'. Peel (Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet, 1788-1850; Prime Minister, 1834–1835 and 1841–1846) says (printed in a speech bubble above his head): 'I cannot let you / pass, if I admit you / the respectable Gent / -leman in the broad / brim and all the / rest, will expect to / get in.'. Wellington (Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington,1769-1852; Prime Minister from 1828 to 1830) adds (in a speech bubble to his right): 'He must not be let in / yet P-l, but if we dont / take care the fellow will / slip in, in spite of us'. Two figures at the centre, O'Connell (Daniel O'Connell, 1775-1847) and Brougham (Henry Peter Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux, 1778-1868; Lord Chancellor, 1830-34), wearing barrister's wig and gown, comment on the scene: O'Connell: 'Agitate friend Moses / Agitate! that's the way / I got in'; Brougham: 'You exclude the Jew / and Quaker while the / Atheist, who laughs at / your oaths, obtain's [sic] / Admission.'. Title printed below the border: 'REPULSED but not DISCOURAGED.'. The publisher's details printed below: 'Published by Thos McLean. 26, Haymarket, May,24.1830.'. Handwritten in graphite at upper right: '63'. The impression is weak. See 16118,_Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires_, Vol. XI, 1828-1832, M.D. George, published 1954, pp. 290-91. A number '[63]' printed in square brackets in the right-hand margin on p. 290 relates to the handwritten number at upper right, both referencing the sequence of John Doyle's Political Sketches series."]
