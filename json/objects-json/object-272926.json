This material comprises 385 bronze coins mainly of the sultanates of Kilwa and Mogadishu (13th/14th cent. AD) and some later Portuguese and local East African issues.  The Islamic coins formed the basis of Freeman-Grenville's studies of these coinages in the Numismatic Chronicle 1957 and 1964, which remains the standard reference.  This group provides many rulers and types that the Fitzwilliam lacks, and it makes sense to keep the bulk of it together (although the Ashmolean has already picked out some pieces) as a group of provenanced material for future study.  The series is one with great variety of epigraphy and added marks, and would repay a more detailed analysis. Dr David Phillipson has kindly made enquiries about the relevant antiquities legislation, and it seems that this came into force in Tanganyika in 1964 and in Zanzibar in 1963.  We are advised that as these coins were brought to Britain in 1960 or earlier they were legally exported."]
