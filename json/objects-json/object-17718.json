Formed of a collar of three upward-overlapping lames front and rear, and integral spaudlers of six lames each.  The upper edge of the collar has a bold, file-roped inward turn.  The lower edge of the collar is straight with a slight central cusp at the rear and obtusely pointed at the front.  The lames are connected to one another by three modern internal leathers front and rear.  The leathers have become detached at some points.  The front and rear sections of the collar are connected to one another at the left side by an internal hinge, and fastened at the right side by a mushroom-shaped stud and a keyhole-slot.  The second lame of the spaudler, which is shaped to the point of the shoulder, and the sixth lame, which is cut away in a concave curve over the front of the armpit, are longer than the others.  The sixth lame has a file-roped inward turn at its lower end, and is fitted at its front edges with a strap and buckle to secure it around the arm.  The turn of the right spaudler is damaged.  The lames of the spaudlers are connected to one another by modern round-headed sliding-rivets with octagonal or internal washers at their rear ends, and by modern internal leathers at their front ends and centres.  The leathers are partly severed.  The front  leather of the right spaudler lacks its upper end which would originally have been fitted with a terminal that engaged a keyhole-slot in the lowest front lame of the collar. Part of the composite half armour HEN.M.3A-E-1933"]
