        "value": ["Large 8vo white lace-paper front mounted onto the album leaf. A title is lithographed in blue ink at upper centre: 'Cupid's Album!'. An ornate lace-paper border with gold ground surrounds a central oval window backed with a white silk panel which is mounted with a collage of hand-coloured cut-paper flowers and leaves with stencilled and hand-drawn additions. The two end sections of the collage lift up to reveal hand-written inscriptions in black ink: 'My favourite one' / 'in all the World'. A small silver paper envelope affixed above opens to reveal a small card of pink paper with a hand-painted spray of blue and white flowers on the front. On the inside, left-hand page is an inscription in blue ink: 'warranted not to change' around a tiny paper heart and on the facing page, a gilt paper ring below which is written, 'Hope'. Two further collages of hand-coloured, cut-paper flowers and leaves with stencilled additions are arranged at lower left and lower right. Each collage lifts up to reveal hand-written inscriptions in black ink: 'I love you' (left) and 'None so dear as you' (right). A hand-written inscription in graphite at upper left: '7/C'. Similar inscriptions/markings in graphite are found on other cards in the same album. 'DOBBS' is stamped at lower centre. 'Dobbs' written in graphite onto the album leaf below the valentine. A clipping from a sale catalogue is affixed to the album leaf: '578  Another Variety, 4to size, with MS lettering heading \"Cupid's Album,\" and \"my favourite one in all the world\" on satin centre, ca. 1830  7s 6d ...'. The clipping is from catalogue No. 34, dated 1923-4 of the bookseller, R.S. Frampton who was based at \"Walton House\", 37 Fonthill Road, Finsbury Park, London, N4. See P.144527-R. P.14528-R is a duplicate catalogue with all pages intact which is useful for cross-referencing. Four of Frampton's catalogues were found in boxes containing Glaisher's valentines. Other cards by Henry Dobbs in the Glaisher albums seem to have been bought in the same sale. See P.14414-R-23 (was lot 580), P.14410-R-12 (was lot 581), P.14410-R-14 (was lot 577). A partial slip of loose paper inscribed in graphite, 'Dobbs', is slipped behind P.14414-R-69. The hand is the same as that which is seen on the album leaves and belongs to Catherine Parsons, local Cambridge historian and Glaisher's close friend, who was responsible for arranging Glaisher's valentine collection into albums. The slip of paper with publisher's name indicates her methods for sorting and arranging Glaisher's valentines."]
