        "value": ["Breastplate with associated skirt, for light field use, decorated with bands in the  'black and white' fashion. Formed of main plate with moveable gussets at the arm-openings and an associated skirt of two lames.  The medially-ridged main plate dips down to the centre of the waist, and projects forward over the belly.  The gussets and the broad, shallow neck-opening have bold, file-roped, inward turns.  Secured by a single externally-flush rivet within the upper end of each gusset is a double-ended, tongued iron buckle to receive the shoulder-strap of a backplate.  The lower edge of the breastplate is flanged outwards to receive a skirt of two upward overlapping lames.  The lames are attached to one another and to the breastplate at their outer ends by modern round-headed rivets with octagonal or square internal washers.  The lower edge of the second lame of the skirt is cut with a shallow arch over the crotch.  The arch has a file-roped inward turn.  The lame is pierced over the arch with a possibly modern hole for the attachment of a cod-piece.  Riveted at each side of the second lame is a modern strap for the suspension of tassets.  A third strap may at some time have existed between them, but is now represented only by a  plugged hole.  Vacant rivet holes, representing former articulation-points, exist at the upper corners of the first lame of the skirt. Part of the composite half armour HEN.M.3A-E-1933"]
