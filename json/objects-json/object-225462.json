        "value": ["Etching on laid paper. Scene within an etched border of a man standing in a landscape, bank and trees at the far right and stream in the left middleground. The man has enlarged facial features - nose, chin and lips - and is seen in three-quarter profile facing left, leaning forward slightly and reading from a manuscript held in his right hand. In the left background a winged ass leaps over a barrel on its side on the ground, the contents of which are leaking out into the stream. The print is trimmed to the platemark. The title is etched in open letters in the lower margin: 'TO MY COUNTRY I MY PEN CONSIGN'. Etched on the plate at lower right: 'Acc.g to Act of Parl on May y.e 7th 1738'. Handwritten annotations in graphite at lower left and right in the margin below the image border attribute the design to [William] Kent: 'Kent del' and the etching to [Jean Baptiste] Chatelain: 'Chatelain aq fort fec'. A further annotation in graphite in the same hand below the etched title: 'Briant of St. Edm.ds Bury m Suffolk'. The print is laid onto a larger sheet of laid paper onto which a label is pasted with a handwritten inscription in graphite: 'A Poet but I have never seen any of his / works which I have been told were / such as would rather provoke criticism / than admiration / he flourished in 1738'.  See also P.14854-R and especially P.14855-R. An impression of this print in the British Museum, 1975,U.1561, attributes the likeness to Raphael Courteville (active 1720-1772)."]
