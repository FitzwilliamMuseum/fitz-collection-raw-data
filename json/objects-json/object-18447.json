        "value": ["Close helmet, for heavy cavalry use, later modified for use in the annual Giuoco del Ponte in Pisa. Formed of a skull with a bevor and barred face-defence attached to it by common pivots, and a single gorget-plate front and rear.  The rounded, one-piece skull rises to  a moderately high medial comb, decorated with file-roping at its crest.  It is repaired at the brow and at each side with large riveted internal patches.  Attached by a pair of round-headed rivets at its nape is a slightly tapering, tubular plume-holder with integral arms.  The pivots that secure the bevor and face-defence to each side of the skull take the form of crude, low-domed rivets with large, circular external washers.  The bevor is weakly shaped to the point of the chin and is repaired with a riveted internal patch at the centre of its U-shaped face-opening which has been cut at its upper end, removing a file-roped inward turn still surviving at its lower end.  It is also repaired with riveted internal patches at its pivot-holes.  Its lower rear corners have been cu t to allow it to fit the skull with which it is clearly associated.   The later face-defence is formed of a simple frame to which vertical bars of a rounded section have been riveted by their spatulate upper and lower ends.  A pierced D-shaped stud riveted at each side of the chin of the face-opening is engaged by a long, flat swivel-hook riveted at each side of the bevor.  The flanged lower edges of the skull and the bevor are each fitted with a single short gorget-plate.  The front gorget-plate is of crude make and clearly a later association.  The lower edges of the gorget-plates have plain inward turns.  That of the rear gorget-plates has a file-roped inward turn.  The skull is decorated to either side of its comb with two groups of triple incised lines.  Similar decoration borders the upper edge of the rear gorget-plate.  The rear and upper edges of the bevor are decorated with pairs of incised lines."]
