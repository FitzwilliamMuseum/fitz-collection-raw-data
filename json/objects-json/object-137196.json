The front of the cup is decorated with a shipping scene with three sailing vessels of graduated size, with distant cliffs and headland, surrounded by a gold border with reserved white triangular motifs. The rest of the exterior has a pale yellow ground overlaid by black architectural ornament reminiscent of wrought ironwork. There are gold bands round the top and bottom, and the handle is decorated with four vertical lines separated by spots. The base is inscribed in blue enamel:  'Before the Wind, Light/Breeze.' The cover is decorated to match the sides and handle, and the sides of the saucer likewise, with a border of gold leaves and berries between concentric circles on the base."]
