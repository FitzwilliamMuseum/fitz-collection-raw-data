Sticks pierced and painted ivory; guards of carved and painted ivory (18+2); rivet of brass; washer of mother-of-pearl.  Front:  Two cartouches on front leaf, the left showing the main scene, probably Flora being watched by a river god in a forest.  Flora is sitting on the ground holding a flower garland, one end of which is held up by a figure with wings (probably an Horae).  A similar creature is crowning Flora with a wreath of flowers.  The river god, wearing a wreath of leaves, is lying on the ground on the left, leaning his arms on a jar with water coming out of it.  He is holding a paddle in his left hand.  The cartouche on the right shows five nymphs in the wood, pointing to the scene on the left.  A black and gold ornament borders the cartouches; free spaces are powdered with mother-of-pearl chips.  Flower pattern in pastel colours in the middle and at both sides of the cartouches and on top of the right cartouche.  Back:  river goddess with wreath of leaves sitting on a bank, leaning her right arm on a jar with water coming out of it and holding a paddle in her left hand.  Forest in the background.  Sprays of flowers flank the scene.  a thin golden line borders the leaf.  Sticks:  The following pattern is repeated three times:  first sticks shaped and painted like a column, the next two pierced and painted with grey scrolling ornaments; again a column and a pair of pierced and painted cut sticks with scrolling ornaments.  Reverse undecorated.  Guards:  Both guards are carved and painted in a similar way:  scrolling, carved ornament on the shoulder; guard proper with painted flowers on flat surface and carved pieces of flowers and shells."]
