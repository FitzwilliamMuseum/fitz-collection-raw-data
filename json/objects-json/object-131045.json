On the top there are applied leaves and flowers: one mauve and white with two leaves: one yellow with mauve centre and one leaf; two blue and white with three leaves and one leaf on the side of the heap of rocks. The Mine Commandant stands on his right leg with his left advanced. He turns his head to his left, and has his left arm bent with the hand on his hip, and his right extended in front holding an axe with a short handle. He has a long curling brownish-grey wig falling down over his right shoulder and back, and wears a bluish-green pillbox hat with a turned up flap at the front inscribed AR (Augustus Rex) in mongram in gold, and a gold edging. He wears a white coat with a pleated rill, gold buttons and edgings, a red waistcoat with gold buttons, white breches and stockings, black knee caps, and black shoes with gold buckles. Behind he wears a long curved black leather apron with a pale brown leatherlining, securing in front under a black pouch, and a holder with two wedges. A sword with a gold hilt is slung on his left sideby a mauve ribbon."]
