The round low mound base is decorated with applied green leaves and eight flowers (yellow, blue, purple and white). At the back it rises up into a rock, and three olive tree stumps: one behind the rock (broken off), and one on either side of it, each having four short branches at the top bearing leaves and black olives (one on each broken off). Apollo sits on the rock with his left leg advanced, holding his lyre in his left hand and playing it with his right. He leans slightly to his left and looks towards his right. He has a laurel wreath over his pale brown hair and as delicately coloured features. His white cloak has a gold edge, and is caught up on the right shoulder with circular brooch with a red cabochon stone. His harp is coloured brown and gold, and a quiver full of arrows with purple flights hangs from a red strap on the tree stump on his right. The dragon, Python, pierced by an arrow, lies on the base on Apollo's  right. It is painted in shades of pale yellow and purple with darker  purple and black spots and red jaws and tongue."]
