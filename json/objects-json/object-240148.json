Seven men sitting or standing around a table with a curtain behind to the right and columns with entablature behind and to the left. Several round pieces of fruit, wine glasses and bottles are on the table. Seated at the far left, Constantine John Phipps, 2nd Lord Mulgrave gestures over his shoulder towards Thomas, Lord Dundas, standing, who holds a gem up to the light between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand. Lord Seaforth, seated to the right, looks at a ring held in his right hand. Charles Greville, almost in profile to the right, raises a full glass of wine together with John Charles Crowle and the Duke of Leeds. Sir Joseph Banks seated at the far right is viewed in profile and examines a ring held outwards into the centre of the table."]
