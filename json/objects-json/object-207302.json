Balance cock with pierced table, with wheel having six rounded spokes, chamfered table edge, mask engraved on neck. Foot engraved. Blued steel end piece with diamond end stone. Polished steel balance. Pierced and engraved slide plate from balance cock to barrel bridge (covers third, fourth and escape jewels, escape with end stone and engraved name). Silver regulating disc numbered 5 to 30 in Arabic figures. Barrel bridge signed and recess to take set-up click and spring. Two round section gongs with central block attached to brass edge. Shaped fusee iron post with 1/2 removed to clear repeating rack arbour. Blued steel perpetual ratchet. Plain repeating barrel. Quarter hammer under runner main wheel, hour hammer under fourth wheel of time train, both clockwise from arbour. Pillar plate with five turned and ringed pillars. Potance screwed to back plate. Centre, third and fourth wheels recessed. Runners, third wheel recessed. Going fusee and chain, set-up click in barrel bridge, one wide lip on barrel, cylinder escapement, steel cylinder and wheel. Train planted clockwise.\nThe balance-cock is of an unusual pattern, and may have been imitated from Larcum Kendall's work.\nThe striking is peculiar. On pressing the pendant, the hours and \"ting-tang\" quarters are struck, followed in the: first quarter by 4 strokes, 3 strokes in the second quarter, 2 strokes  in the third quarter, 1 stroke in the fourth quarter.  The purpose of this arrangement is not evident, it was perhaps fitted to some special order.\n\nREPEATING MECHANISM: Polished steel half quarter stogden.\n\nBRASS EDGE: Plain gilt brass, fixed by two screws into side of movement, gongs also fixed to edge.\n\nDIAL: Gold, minute ring dots, radial Roman chapters, black filled, plain inner ring. Centre straight line engine turned. Stamped on back 'FC' over 'F HB'.\n\nHANDS: Thin blued steel heart-shaped ends.\n\nCAP: Gilt brass, only covers top of movement. Cover added over regulator segment, hole for barrel arbour extension, winding square pipe. Oval raised table. Cap with edge mouldings.\n\nCASE: Gold, single back. Opens front and back, and has an inner bottom. Back with London HM 1812. Rubbed incised maker's stamp 'FC' over 'F HB'. Body ribbed, back off set engine turned. Scratch marks inside back '127D, 060H, P 7 T 2/665/71, B/B 02 03, 7752H, K, Mrs. Musgrave, 180'. Cylindrical pendant with ring bow."]
