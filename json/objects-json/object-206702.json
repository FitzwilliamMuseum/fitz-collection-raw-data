The partially covered spout is applied below a moulding at the top, and has foliage in relief at its base. The top of the rim has two shallow  indentations. The cover is flat on top with a sloping rim,  and a knob in the shape of a pear-shaped jar and cover. Underneath it has a hollow cylindrical centre with two projections which fit into the indentations in the rim,  and when turned to right or left, hold the cover in position when the pot is being tipped forward.  The sides of the pot are decorated al sassone with two different scenes of putti mourning broken-heartedly beside urns on pedestals in a garden setting surrounded by frames comprising two pale purple kidney shaped and two smaller heartshaped  panels, linked by dainty red and gold strapwork and scrolls . The edges and moulded foliage on the handle and spout are picked out in gold, and there are two gold bands round the foot and the rim at the top. The cover has two pale kidney-shaped panels, flanked by red and gold scrolls, and its knob has a gold band round its upper edge, and a gold top"]
