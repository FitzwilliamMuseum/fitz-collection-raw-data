The underside is unglazed except for a small area near the middle, where there is a small round ventilation hole. The base has a shaped edge decorated with scrolls and a rocaille shell at centre front, and at the back has a tree stump with short flowering branches projecting on each side. The gallant steps forward on his right leg, and is supported by the tree against his left leg. His head and body are inclined slightly to his right; his left arm hangs down behind him, his right is bent at the elbow and his right index finger is pointing towards himself. He has almost black hair tied back in a queue with a black ribbon, grey eyebrows, blue eyes, pink cheeks and a red mouth. He wears a ring on each hand, a shirt with ruffles, a pale lilac coat with a turquoise lining, gold buttons and trimmings; a white waistcoat scattered with blue flower heads, and with a border of red foliage; white breeches with stripes of puce flower heads and leaves; white stockings, and black shoes with gold buckles. His black, broad-brimmed hat, trimmed with a blue ribbon, lies on the ground behind him.  The tree stump is unevenly coloured dark grey, and flowers on either side of it are yellow and orange, blue and yellow, and pink and yellow. The scrolls on the base are picked out in gold, and the rocaille shell motif at the front is partly pink."]
