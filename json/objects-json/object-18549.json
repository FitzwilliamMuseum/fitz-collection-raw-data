Formed of a skull, a flat, obtusely-pointed peak, a sliding nasal-bar with a retaining staple and wing-headed locking-screw, a broad, obtusely-pointed neck-defence of four upward-overlapping lames, and a pair of pendant cheek-pieces.  The one-piece hemispherical skull is decorated with six radiating ribs and a raised border at each side of its lower edge, and fitted at its apex with a pierced finial retaining a circular washer.  The peak, which is attached to the brow of the skull by round-headed rivets, is pierced at its centre to receive the sliding nasal-bar which, together with its retaining staple and locking-screw, is a modern restoration.\nThe cheek-pieces, which are now detached, have concave front and rear edges that converge towards their lower ends.  They are each pierced with seven ventilation-holes in a rosette-formation.  The main edges of the peak, the neck-defence and the cheek-pieces have plain inward turns.  The helmet retains substantial fragments of its leather lining-bands."]
