        "value": ["Burgonet with restored buffe, for medium and light cavalry use. The burgonet is formed of a one-piece skull with an integral peak, a pair of modern, hinged cheek-pieces and a neck-defence of one lame.  The rounded skull rises to a high medial comb that extends from just above the brow to just above the nape, and is decorated along its crest with file-roping.  The medially-ridged peak projects forward to a pronounced central point.  Its edge has a file-roped inward turn.  A later or later-enlarged hole that serves to accommodate a peg projecting from the upper edge of the buffe is pierced towards the rear of the centre of the peak.  The lower front edge of the skull is cut away in a large arch at each side to accommodate the cheek-pieces.  The apex of each arch is cut with a deep, rectangular notch to accommodate the hinge of the cheek-piece.  The skull is fitted with eight externally-flush lining-rivets around the brow, and a further eight around the nape.  These in some cases retain fragments of a leather lining-band.  The second from left rivet at the nape lacks its head.  A pair of holes for the attachment of a plume-holder, pierced at the nape a short distance below the base of the comb, are now plugged with modern, externally-flush rivets.  The lower edge of the skull is flanged outwards at its rear to receive the neck-defence.  Attached by a pair of later, externally-flush rivets within each side of the skull, just above and to the front of the attachment-points for the cheek-pieces, is a round-ended bar.  Screwed into a threaded bar is a later slotted, round-headed pivot.  Each side of the skull shows a crack in its edge, just behind the peak.  That at the right side has been repaired with a small, riveted internal patch which has itself subsequently cracked through.  The modern cheek-pieces are attached to the skull by plain, modern, internal hinges with cropped corners, secured by pairs of externally-flush rivets at either ends.  It is likely that the original hinges were secured by three rivets at either end, as a third rivet-hole, now plugged with a modern, externally flush rivet, is pierced just above and between the presently used pair of holes in the skull.  The upper rear corner of each cheek-piece is cut off diagonally at the hinge, and the upper front corner of each cheek-piece is cut with a V-shaped notch to accommodate the rear of the peak.  Each cheek-piece has slightly convex upper and front edges and a straight rear edge.  Its lower edge is flanged outwards to form a continuation of the neck-defence.  The flange has a rounded front corner.  The front and lower edge of each cheek-piece has a file-roped inward turn.  Attached by an externally-flush rivet within the front edge of each cheek-piece, just above the angle of its flange, is a modern chin-strap.  The right strap terminates in a modern, single-ended, tongued, iron buckle with a rectangular loop decorated all around with a single incised line.  Attached to the flanged lower edge of the skull by a modern, brass-capped, round-headed rivet at each side is a neck-defence of one medially-ridged lame.  The right rivet has a circular internal washer.  The lower edge of the neck-defence descends to an obtuse, central point.  It has a file-roped inward turn accompanied by nine lining-rivets which are of brass-capped, round-headed form, except for each of the outer ones which are of externally-flush form to permit the overlap of the cheek-pieces.  The central rivet is fitted with an octagonal, internal washer, retaining a fragment of a leather lining-band.\nThe buffe is formed of a bevor protecting the chin, two falling, upper extension-plates protecting the face from the level of the mouth to just below the level of the eyes, and a single gorget-hole protecting the throat.  The bevor is medially-ridged and shaped to the chin.  The two downward-overlapping falling-plates are also medially ridged.  The upper edges of the bevor and each of the falling-plates rises to an obtuse, central point.  That of the top falling-plate, which is taller than the bottom one, also rises slightly at its outer ends and is decorated with a file-roped inward turn.  The top falling-plate is crudely stepped for the greater part of its width, midway down from  its upper edge.  Attached within it by a pair of externally-flush rivets located just below the centre of the step is a vertical rod of circular section that engages the hole in the peak of the burgonet.  The lower end of the rod is forged to a broad, spatulate form to accommodate the retaining-rivets.  Each side of the top falling-plate is pierced above the step with a pair of horizontal, dumbel-shaped ventilation-slots.  The right side of the top falling-plate is pierced beneath its step with  five similarly-shaped diagonal ventilation-slots, sloping upwards and inwards.  The left side of the top falling-plate is pierced beneath its step with two circles of six ventilation-holes, each surrounding a similar hole.  The pattern of diagonal ventilation-slots and circular ventilation-holes pierced beneath the step of the top falling-plate is repeated in the bottom falling-plate.  The plates are connected to one another and to the bevor at their outer ends by modern, brass-capped, round-headed rivets with circular internal washers.  The lower corners of both falling-plates have downward-projecting lobes that accommodate the rivets.  Attached by a pair of externally-flush rivets within the right side of the upper edge both of the bevor and the bottom falling-plate is a horizontal spring-strip.  Riveted to the inner end of each spring is a bevelled rectangular stud that protrudes through a rectangular hole in its respective plate to support the overlying falling-plate which is cut with a shallow rectangular notch at the point where it rests on the stud.  Attached by an externally-flush rivet at each side of the neck of the bevor is a leather strap.  The short right one terminates in a double-ended, tongued, iron buckle, while the longer left one is pierced with holes to engage the tongue of the buckle.  The straps fasten around the rear of the neck of the burgonet.  The lower edge of the bevor is flanged outwards to receive the single, deep gorget-plate.  The lower edge of the gorget-plate descends to an obtuse, central point and has strongly rounded outer corners.  It has a file-roped inward turn accompanied by nine, brass-capped, round-headed lining-rivets with circular internal washers.  Similar rivets and washers connect the gorget-plates to the flange of the bevor at either side. Part of the composite half armour HEN.M.5A-E-1933"]
