        "value": ["Burgonet, for light cavalry use, decorated in the 'black and white' fashion. Formed of a two-piece skull with an integral peak and neck-defence, and a pair of hinged cheek-pieces.  The rounded skull is made in two halves joined along the crest of a fairly high medial comb by a turn to the left, and along the centres of the peak and neck-defence by riveted overlaps.  Each overlap is secured by a pair of externally-flush rivets.  The lower rivet of the neck-defence is missing.  A later wiring-hole has been pierced just to the left of it.  The peak and neck-defence both have curved edges projecting to an obtuse central point.  The point of the neck-defence has been damaged.  The lower front edge of the skull is cut away in a large arch at each side to accommodate the cheek-pieces.  The apex of each arch is cut with a shallow, rectangular notch to accommodate the hinge of the cheek-piece.  The skull is fitted with six lining-rivets around the brow and a further six around the nape.  All are of round-headed form except for the outer two at the brow, which are externally-flush to allow the overlap of the cheek-pieces.  The cheek-pieces are attached to the skull by plain, internal hinges with cropped corners, secured by pairs of round-headed rivets.  The left hinge and its rivets are modern replacements.  The front and lower edges of the cheek-pieces are very slightly convex.  The lower edges are flanged outwards to form a continuation of the neck-defence.  The upper and rear edges curve in to a straight section at the hinge.  The centre of each cheek-piece is decorated with a single, round-headed rivet.  Attached within the lower front corner of the left cheek-piece by a modern, externally-flush rivet is a modern, single-ended, tongued, iron buckle with a rectangular loop and plain hasp, which engages a modern leather strap attached by a further modern, externally-flush rivet within the lower front corner of the right cheek-piece.  The main edges of the peak, the cheek-pieces and the neck-defence have plain, inward turns accompanied by a narrow groove and a raised border.  Raised bands, which flare distally where they merge with the border, decorate the centre of the peak and neck-defence.  A broad, raised band decorates each side of the skull, and a narrower raised band decorates the upper and rear edges of each cheek-piece.  The crest of the comb is decorated at each side with a narrow groove matching that of the main edges."]
