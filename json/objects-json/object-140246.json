The flat, unglazed base has a large L-shaped aperture which reveals the hollow underside of the rocky base and figure. The back, which was made separately and applied to the base, has a wide, oblong aperture, slightly curved on its lower side. \nThe top of the high rocky base has a short tree stump on the viewer’s left and a vine branch on the right which curves around the top of the back. A female panther reclines on the front of the rock holding a bunch of grapes between its forepaws. Its head is turned upwards and to its left, and in its open mouth it has a grape. The nude Ariadne is seated on the rock, with her left knee drawn up and her left leg extended downwards. She leans forward and looks down towards the panther. Her left arm rests on the rock, cradling a basket of grapes, other fruit and foliage. She holds a bunch of grapes in her right hand which rests on top of the basket.Her greyish-black hair is drawn back into a loose knot at the back of her head, and waving tresses hang down her back. She wears a vine wreath on her head, and has a gold bracelet on her left wrist, and a tambourine hanging on a red and gold strap which passes over her left shoulder and under her right arm."]
