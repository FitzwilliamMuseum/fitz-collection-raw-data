Brougham (without wig) sits on a chaise beside a sleeping King William IV. Brougham is speaking, but has apparently not noticed that the King is asleep: 'Then, I say that for these _various_ and _manifold_ resons, it may become matter of grave deliberation, with your M-J-ty whether in the undoubted exercise of your R-y-l / prerogative you should not * ..........'. Groups of ladies and gentlemen sitting on ottomans in the background watch the pair from the left. Signed with monogram at lower left: 'HB'. Title printed below the border: 'AN AFTER DINNER SCENE / (AT WINDSOR)'. The publisher's details printed below border at left: 'Published by Thos McLean, 26, Haymarket, Octr. 12th 1831.'. The printer's details are not given but there is evidence that they have been excised from the plate at lower right. George states that the printer was Charles Motte. Printed above the border at upper right: 'HB Sketches No 160.'. See 16796,_Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires_, Vol. XI, 1828-1832, M.D. George, published 1954, pp.529-30."]
