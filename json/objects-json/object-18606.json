      {
        "value": ["'Almain' collar, for light field use, lacking its integral spaudlers. Formed of four upward-overlapping lames front and rear.  The upper edge of the top lame in each instance has a boldly roped inward turn accompanied by a pair of incised lines, and by seven externally flush  rivets on the front lame and six on the rear lame.  The bottom lame in each instance is considerably deeper than the rest.  The lower edge of the front one is obtusely pointed at its centre, while the lower edge of the rear one is almost straight with a low cusp at its centre where it is pierced with a pair of lace-holes.  Both the front and rear sections of the collar are decorated with three low ridges radiating downwards and outwards from the neck and fading out at their upper and lower ends.  The upper edges of the second to fourth lames in each instance are decorated at the ridges with v-shaped nicks.  The fourth lame in each instance is also decorated with a narrow recessed band bordered above by a narrow, raised rib enclosed by a pair of incised lines, and descending as three cusps at the ridges.  The lames were originally connected to one another by three internal leathers front and rear.  Each leather was retained by pairs of rivets which were externally flush on the first to third lames and round-headed with internal washers on the fourth lame.  Construction-holes aligning with the  rivet-holes for the outer leathers of the second to fourth lames were originally filled with purely decorative round-headed rivets.  These construction-holes and the underlying leathering holes are now filled by modern round-headed rivets and circular internal washers that secure the lames to one another directly at their outer ends.  The unused outer pairs of leathering-holes on the fourth lame in each instance are now filled by modern, round-headed rivets.  The lames are further connected to one another by a modern central leather front and rear, secured only by a single externally-flush rivet passing through the right of the pair of leathering holes, except on the fourth lame where it is secured by a pair of round-headed rivets with circular internal washers.  The front and rear sections of the collar are connected to one another at the top of the left side by means of an internal hinge, originally secured by a pair of externally-flush rivets front and rear of which the top rear one is now missing.  The lower rear corner of the hinge, which is shaped around the rivets, is now broken away.  The front and rear sections of the collar were originally fastened to one another at the right side by means of a mushroom-shaped stud on the fourth rear lame engaging a keyhole slot in the corresponding front lame, and a pair of small, vertically aligned plain studs on the first rear lame engaging a pair of circular holes in the corresponding front lame.  The small plain studs are now missing.  The mushroom-shaped stud, which has a circular internal washer,  is a modern replacement.  The outer ends of the fourth rear lame are each pierced at the tops of the shoulders and near their lower corners with pairs of rivet-holes for the attachment of the internal leathers that formerly retained the missing integral spaudlers.  The upper hole of the lower right pair is occupied by a modern, externally-flush rivet, while the upper hole of the left upper pair is broken away.  The left outer end of the fourth front lame is pierced near its lower corner with a hole for the sliding rivet that formerly retained the left spaudler, while the lower edge of the same lame is pierced near its right end with an L-shaped keyhole slot to receive the strap-end of the missing right spaudler.  A triangular section of the lower edge of the fourth front lame has broken away, as has the upper left corner of the fourth rear lame which is now repaired with an internal patch secured by three externally flush rivets and a fourth rivet with a large round-headed rivet  and a circular internal washer that retains a fragment of a modern leather strap.  A similar round-headed rivet with a rectangular internal washer, occupying a later hole, also retains a fragment of a modern leather strap.  The outer ends of the collar, including the patched repair, are pierced with various later rivet and wiring-holes, especially on the tops of the shoulders and the lower corners."]
