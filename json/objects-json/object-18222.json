I wanted a Gothic suit but parted with a rare piece'.  The jack, from a house in Tonbridge, Kent, is now part of the Bashford Dean Memorial Collection in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.

The rings are of a heavier construction over the chest and back than elsewhere.  The shirt opens all the way down the front.  It is of mid-thigh length, with a square-cut neck, and sleeves that extend to just below the elbows, and a central division to the crotch at the rear of the skirt.  A line of smaller links down the centre of the back suggests that the shirt has been altered or repaired at some time, perhaps during its working life.  A number of links are missing throughout the shirt, especially at its edges.  The shirt is bright with light patination throughout. Part of the composite Spanish armour M.13A-K-1941."]
