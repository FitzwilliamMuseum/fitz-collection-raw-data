        "value": ["Van Loon supposes this medal to have been struck by some over-zealous reformers and partisans of Leicester, who offered the government to Elizabeth; and throws mystery over the termination of the legend as implying more than the suppliants dare express. Now in size, style, taste and workmanship, as well as mint mark, it corresponds with other medals struck at this period by order of the States; it can then scarcely be considered as the production of a party cabal, but a fair expression of the sentiments of the Provinces. They successfully claimed the aid of Elizabeth and were thankful; and, considering Leicester the champion of their cause, they introduce him in that character upon the medal. The legend terminates abruptly for want of space, and because the meaning was sufficiently intelligible. The reverse symbolizes the defeat of the Papal party in the Provinces. This a beautiful and emotive medal of unusually large size showing the gratitude of the Provinces for the help given by Elizabeth I. Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester (1586-1588), was very close to Queen Elizabeth I. He had been appointed Governor and Captain-General of the United Provinces in 1586 - one year before this medal was struck."]
