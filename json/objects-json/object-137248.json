The candlestick is in the form of a winged Cupid supporting two scrolled branches terminating in candle nozzles and drip-pans, attached to the arms by means of a screw, rivet and nut. He sits on a high base with three elaborately scrolled feet, and a flat back.  His flesh is tinted in pink, and he has short pale brown hair, and wing feathers touched with blue and pale purple.  He is nude except for a polychrome floral garland passing across his body from his left shoulder to his right hip, and a band and bow on his right arm, from which is suspended a mainly gold drape which covers the lower part of his body at the front, and ends by his left calf. He has a quiver by his left side. The candle branches, their nozzles, and drip-pans are outlined in gold, as are the scrolls on the base. Its top is decorated with a large purple, red, and green butterfly. On the back the edges are outlined in green and gold."]

These appear to be of higher quality than the Fitzwilliams, and are dated to c. 1758-65. On p. 92 the authors compared these figures with two, both with girls, in the Walters Museum, Baltimore, inv. nos. 48.813 and 48.814, which they considered to be later, seeming to be of Duesbury's early production."]
