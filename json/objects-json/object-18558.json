The hemispherical skull is formed of a pate-plate and two side-plates that are joined by brazing.  Attached by four externally-flush rivets around the base of the skull is a trellis formed of two horizontal bands and four radiating vertical bars that are joined by brazing.  The trellis stands proud of the skull.  Brazed to the front of the lower horizontal band is a broad, flat peak with a strongly convex front edge.  Seven narrower bands radiate from the apex of the skull to the bottom of the lower horizontal band and its peak.  Hinged to the lower end of each of these, as well as three of the broader vertical bars, are a total of ten outward curving bars.  All the bars are of slender form except for that at the neck which is considerably broader than the rest.  The hinged bars can be folded upwards and secured at the apex of the skull beneath a domed circular plate that can be pressed down over their terminals and held in place by a sprung catch.  The catch can be released by pressing down a linked stud that protrudes through a slot cut in the lower half of the front, vertical bar.  Riveted at each side of the lower horizontal bar is a horizontal staple, possibly for the attachment of a cheek-piece."]
