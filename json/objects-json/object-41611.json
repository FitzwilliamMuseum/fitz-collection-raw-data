The closed base is unglazed and has a central ventilation hole. The rounded oval base has incurved and scrolled sides with a square aperture at the back to take an attachment. The shepherd stands in front of a tree trunk with a branch on the proper right bearing a few applied leaves and a berry, and on the left, a sawn off branch and four leaves. A sheep stands on his left, and a dog reclines on his right, looking up at him. He strides forward on his left leg trailing his right behind him. His head is turned to his right and he holds the bagpipe in both hands. His pale brown hair is tied back with a dark brown bow, and he has a pink tricorn hat with a maroon ribbon round the crown. He wears a white shirt with sleeve ruffles, a yellow waistcoat scattered with groups of four brown dots, and with brown buttons; a white coat with a polychrome floral pattern, a pink collar, and maroon buttons; blue breeches with brown bows at the knees; white stockings, and red shoes with yellow bows. The tree trunk and the top of the base are coloured pale green and brown; the sheep is pale yellowish-green and brown, and the dog greyish-brown and white with a dark brown nose and collar. There are applied leaves and two dark pink flowers on the proper left and front of the base. The edges and sides are picked out in dark grey, with wavy lines, dots, and strokes."]
