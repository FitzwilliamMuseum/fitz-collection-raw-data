Production details etched at upper left: 'APond fecit / 1739'. Title, engraved at lower centre and lower right: 'Tho. Sadler Arm. / NIL CONSCIRE SIBI. / 1739'. Watermark: 'VI'. On the verso are initials in pen and ink: 'W.?S' and in graphite, 'Antiquary?'. The etching is affixed at upper left and upper right corners to a larger sheet of heavy, white wove paper (height 341mm x width 240mm) which is inscribed in graphite at lower centre: 'Antiquary?'. An etched portrait of Thomas Sadler (died 1754) by Arthur Pond. Sadler was a civil servant who served in the Treasury as Deputy-Clerk of the Pells under Sir Edward Walpole (1706-1784). He was also an antiquary and amateur artist who 'distinguished himself as a person of taste, made drawings and formed a fine collection of agates, shells etc. which were sold at his death January 3rd, 1754.'. (See Noble, p. 349). He was the son of the artist, Thomas Sadler (fl. 1670–1700) and grandson of the lawyer and political reformer, John Sadler (1615–1674) who was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge and Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge from 1650. The British Museum holds a working proof of the portrait before the lettering was added (See, 1870,0514.1983) and an early state with production details added but before the engraving of the title (See, 1977,U.426). P.147921-R is another impression which has a visible platemark."]
