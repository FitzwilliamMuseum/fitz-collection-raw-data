The tassets are each formed of nineteen upward-overlapping lames, terminating in winged poleyns, each formed of four lames that overlap outwards from the third which is shaped to the point of the knee.  The tassets can be separated between their thirteenth and fourteenth lames where they are connected to one another by studs and keyhole-slots.  The first lame in each instance is angled inward at its upper edge.  The centre of the inward-angled section is boxed to fit over the hinge that formerly connected it to the breastplate.  The first thirteen lames are connected to one another by three modern internal leathers secured by pairs of rivets.  The remaining lames of the tassets and their poleyns are connected to one another by rivets at their outer ends.  Many of the connecting-rivets are now missing.  The wings of the poleyns are of heart-shaped form with pronounced central puckers. The tassets have file-roped inward turns at their main edges, and are decorated with pairs of incised lines and filed nicks, cusps and ogees at their subsidiary edges. Part of the composite three-quarter armour HEN.M.15A-F-1933."]
