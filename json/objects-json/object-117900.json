Sticks of fretted horn decorated with steel sequins; guards of fretted horn decorated with steel sequins.  Rivet of steel; washer of mother-of-pearl.  Front:  On a hill, a cupid is lying on a vehicle with doves, flowers and orange drapery which is torn by two boys, one carrying an arrow with a flaming heart, the other carrying a houlette with a hat.  a woman is standing on the right and another woman is coming up the hill; on the left a winged boy is leading the way with a torch and a flag with a flaming heart, crossed by two arrows attached to a long arrow.  There are buildings and trees on either side in the background; the left building is in classical style.  Top, left and right borders are of gold foliage with pink roses and semicircles with half flowers; the lower border is of a thin, wavy gold line and the top edging is of gold foil.  Back:  a small scene in the centre entitled 'La Belle Jardini√®re' shows a man and a woman in contemporary dress working in a garden; he is raking, she is watering flowers.  On the right and on the left there are sprays of gold flowers.  The top left and right borders are decorated with gold patterns and leaves, and pink flowers.  Sticks:  the sticks are pierced with plants and have rows of sequins in the middle and on top.  Reverse:  blue painted dots instead of sequins.  Guards:  there is a row of seven sequins on the shoulder and at the guard proper groups of sequins alternate with plants."]
