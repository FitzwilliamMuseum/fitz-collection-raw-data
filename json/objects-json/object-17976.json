The breastplate is formed in one piece, in the late 'peascod' fashion, with a flange at the waist.  A modern mushroom-shaped stud riveted at each side of its chest receives the shoulder-straps of the backplate.  A pierced stud, possibly for the attachment of a reinforce, is riveted at the centre of the neck-opening.  Three modern straps for the attachment of tassets are incorrectly riveted at each side of the waist-flange.\nThe backplate is formed in one piece with a flange at the waist.  A later scaled shoulder-strap is riveted at each shoulder.  Its long terminal scale is pierced with two keyhole slots.  The inner of the pair of rivets that attaches each shoulder strap also secures a modern single-ended, tongueless buckle, probably intended for the attachment of pauldrons.  Pierced studs, possibly for the attachment of a reinforce, are riveted at the centre of the neck-opening and the centre of the waist, respectively.  Attached by a single rivet at each side of the waist is a modern strap forming a waist-belt.  The right strap terminates in a modern double-ended, tongued iron buckle.  The main edges of both the breastplate and backplate have file-roped inward turns.  The breastplate shows traces of a medial band of pointillé decoration. Part of the composite half armour HEN.M.16A-F-1933."]
