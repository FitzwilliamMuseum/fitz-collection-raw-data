Painted overglaze in blue, pale turquoise, two shades of green, yellow, orange-red, pink, puce, and purple enamels. The concave underside is glazed except for the edges and has a circular cream plug in the central hole. The base is approximately circular with a shaped edge formed by a shell and rococo scrolls and moss. It rises up into a tree trunk with the remains of a metal alloy attachment low down in its back. On the front of the base of the trunk there are two groups of an orange and a blue applied flower and leaves. The tree has a short lateral branch on the viewer's left, and on the right, a branch which divides into two. The lower branch curves round in front of the trunk, and the other rises upwards and then curves to the left. The parrot perches on the lower branch looking towards the right. Depending from the branches there are four large fruits resembling plums or peaches. The parrot is painted in polychrome excluding green. The green leaves on the branches are interspersed with small red berries, and the fruits are pale pink and puce. The shell and scrolls on the base are picked out in puce, and the moss is green."]
