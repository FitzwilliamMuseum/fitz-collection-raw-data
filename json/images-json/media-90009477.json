          ["Hachiman Taro Yoshiie. Gakutei, Yashima (Japanese, 1786(?)-1868). Surimono. Colour print from woodblocks, with metallic pigment, circa 1820-circa 1823. Ukiyo-e. Poetry by Bunshusha Suehiro, Ran Kanemaru and Tountei Hotaru. Notes: From the series Katsushika nijushiko (Twenty-four Generals for the Katsushika Group). Minamoto no Yoshiie (1039-1106) was the son of the Minamoto general Yoriyoshi who dreamed that the God of War, Hachiman, appeared to him and gave him a sword. When his wife bore him Yoshiie, Yoriyoshi gave his son the additional boyhood name of Hachiman Taro. At an early age Yoshiie became an accomplished warrior. Here he sits before his father studying. The poems read: ‘The wind brought the fragrance of plum blossoms to the window of the house where they were studying the book of strategy.’ ‘Today, just as the seams of last year’s robe come unsewn, the fragrance of opening plum blossoms comes in the breeze.’ ‘The plum blossoming by the window of the warrior’s study seems to have a mind and understand.’"]
