          ["Shield of Achilles. Flaxman, John, designer, after (British, 1755-1826). Rundell, Bridge and Rundell, maker, London. Pitts, William, chaser, possibly (British, 1790-1840). Bronze, cast and chased, diameter 89.50 cm, dated 1824. In the centre, the chariot of the Sun, surrounded by the constellations. The scenes in the border are (1) the marriage procession and banquet; (2) the quarrel and judicial appeal; (3) the siege and ambuscade; (4) the harvest field; (5) the vintage; (6) the shepherds defending their flocks; and (7) the Cretan dance. The rim is embossed with the mighty Stream of Ocean. On the reverse there are four rings for suspension at the top, and a cross bar with a central hole. The reverse is engraved close to the edge 'DESIGNED AND MODELLED BY JOHN FLAXMAN RA/EXECUTED BY RUNDELL BRIDGE & RUNDELL JEWELLERS TO HIS MAJESTY/MDCCXXIV' (1824). The idea of creating the shield for Rundell & Bridge dates from about 1810, but it was early 1817 before Flaxman completed his design. He modelled the shield himself. The model  was cast in plaster, and the detail was carved into it. Three or perhaps more bronze casts were made in Dean Street, and were said to have been chased by William Pitts junior, before the first silver version was cast in 1819. This was gilded and sold to George IV in 1821. The original silver shield in the collection of H.M. the Queen at Windsor, was designed and modelled by John Flaxman from the description in the 18th book of the Iliad of the shield made in encrusted iron for Achilles by the god Hephaestus. It is hallmarked for 1821-22 and bears the maker's mark of Philip Rundell of Rundell, Bridge & Rundell. It measures 955 mm. D. At least four silver-gilt and four bronze copies were made, possibly more. An electrotype version was shown by Hunt and Roskell in the Fine Arts Court of the Great Exhibition of 1851. According to the anonymous author of Memoirs of the Late Philip Rundell Esq., published shortly after his death in 1827, it was conceived as a tribute to the Duke of Wellington. See Royal Academy exhibition catalogue John Flaxman, 1979."]
