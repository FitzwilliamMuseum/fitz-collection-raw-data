          ["Maiolica. Jar. Unknown maker, perhaps The Veneto, Venice or The Marches, Italy. Globular body with very short neck and flat base.The main field is decorated with five parrots amidst coiling leafy stems bearing five groups of three, and five single, quinces or pears, and berries. Round the lower part, reading from top to bottom: (a) a green horizontal band between wide and narrow blue bands; (b) an invected orange band and another above with trefoils on the points; and (c) a narrow and a wide horizontal blue band. Round the neck, reading from bottom to top, (a), (b), and a narrow blue band and a green band between broad blue bands. Earthenware, tin-glazed off-white on the interior and exterior; rim and base unglazed. Painted in blue, green, yellow, and orange. Height, whole, 33.9 cm, diameter, rim, 15.4 cm, diameter, base, 16.0 cm, width, widest, 31.5 cm, circa 1575-1650. Production Note: Attributed by Rackham (1935) to Faenza, and later attributed to Venice, but this is doubtful. The form is similar to Venetian jars, but it differs from most of them in having parrots amidst the fruit, and in the scallop and trefoil borders round the base and shoulder. Most Venetian examples have either blue criss-cross borders, or horizontal stems of foliage. It also differs from typical Venetian jars in having a thin, glassy glaze which has crazed severely. The foliage and berries are reminiscent of those which appear on dishes attributed to Pesaro in the mid 16th century."]
