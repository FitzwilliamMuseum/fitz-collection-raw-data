          ["Ecclesiastical flagon. Church plate. Keith, John, silversmith. Butterfield, William, designer, possibly (1814-1900). The flagon stands on a circular foot with a convex mojulding round the edge, and rises in a slight convex cjrve to a very short stem with an anulet concealing the junction of the ovoid ruby glass body. About half-way up, the body is encircled by a silver-gilt band engraved 'GLORY BE TO GOD ON hIGh + ' with a leaf between each word and a background of horizontal striations. The lower part of the neck is engraved with a formal trefoil leaf ornament between horizontal ribs. The projecting sparrow-beak spout is engraved with a fleur-de-lis, and the stepped and slightly convex cover is engraved with four leaves forming a cross surrounded by small circles between two concentric circles. The cover is hinged to the handle, and has a 'twisted rope' thumbpiece. The S-shaped handle has a three-dimensional fleur-de-lis at each end, and is engraved with a vertical line flanked by pairs of diagonal lines of graduated sizes. The body is attached to the foot by means of a screw and nut. Ruby (blown) glass mounted in silver-gilt with engraved ornament, height, to top of finial, 26.4 cm, diameter, foot, 9.5 cm, between 1865-1866. Gothic Revival. Victorian."]
