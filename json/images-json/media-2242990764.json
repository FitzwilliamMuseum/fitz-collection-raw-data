          ["Fragment of the Ten of Clubs. The upper half of the card, with the upper edge also missing. Five out of the ten pips are present. The position of the central pip in the upper portion of the card indicates that there would have been a second pip below and confirms the card as the Ten of Clubs rather than the Nine of Clubs. There is a crease across the card where it has been folded. There are two holes at the centre, which are most likely stitching holes relating to the secondary use of the card as a stiffening material in bookbinding. See W.M. Fletcher, who describes other playing cards and MSS found near staircase A at Trinity College in 1902 which are ‘pierced with stitching holes containing fragments of thread’ and states that, ‘These no doubt represent some rubbish from destroyed book bindings, for it should be remembered that this staircase provided a back way to the College Library when it was housed in this block’. Hand-coloured woodcut on pasteboard. French, 17th century."]
