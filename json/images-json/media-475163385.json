          ["Islamic pottery, Minai. Dish. Unknown potter, Iran. Shape: plain rim on a shallow, hemispherical bowl sitting on a wide, moderately high foot ring. Interior: a grey dentilated pattern on the rim above a thin black concentric line, both framing decoration on the body which is outlined and detailed in black and painted in black, red and shades of grey. This design comprises an enthroned figure, flanked by attendants to the right and left, as well as by griffins and arabesques above and below. The attendant figures have one arm raised toward the enthroned figure, all of them wearing gold leaf arm bands. Both humans and griffins wear red or grey hats and their robes, or coats, are painted in grey or red and are lightly incised with a variety of patterns from circles to swirling tendrils. The pointed leaves of the arabesques are painted with grey and are adorned with red dots. Exterior: rim is painted in grey. A thick, even glaze covers the surface to the mid point on the exterior of the foot ring. Fritware, thrown. coated in a thick, crazed white glaze painted (probably over the glaze) with black, red, shades of grey and gilding.
