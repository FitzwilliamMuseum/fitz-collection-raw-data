          ["Posset pot/spouted jar. Islamic pottery, Minai. Unknown, potter, probably Kashan. Shape: bulbous body with a cylindrical neck and plain rim, sitting on a low foot ring. Opposing cheetah handles and angular spouts are attached to the upper body. Exterior: the rim is painted with a blue dentilated pattern. On the upper body, a frieze of mounted horsemen and two standing figures each separated by feather-like foliage, are identically dressed in hats, tunics, and leggings, occasionally wearing golf leaf arm bands. This frieze is delineated above and below by narrow bands of Arabic script, possibly pseudo epigraphic. On the lower body, a frieze of alternately transposed triangular floral garlands is painted. All these friezes are outlined in black and coloured with blue, turquoise, red and black. Two lion shaped handles, with red heads and bodies decorated with blue stripes and turquoise and red dots, are joined to the upper body. White glaze runs unevenly over the lower body and in places onto the foot ring. Interior: blue paint continues on the rim, while on the neck black Arabic script (cursive) is painted. Remainder is undecorated except for a covering of white glaze. Fritware, wheel thrown body and moulded handles and spout, coated in an opaque white, slightly crazed glaze; decorated with blue and turquoise in-glaze painting, black and red overglaze painting and gilding. Height, whole, 14.5 cm, width, whole, 17.4 cm, diameter, rim, 11.3 cm, diameter, base, 8.9 cm, weight, whole, 708 g, circa 1180-1219. Seljuk Period."]
