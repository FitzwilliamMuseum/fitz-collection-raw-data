          ["Inscription surrounded by floral border: Harebell. Inscription surrounded by floral border: Rose. Bicknell, Clarence (British, 1842-1918). Watercolour over graphite on paper, height, leaf, 326  mm, width, leaf, 255 mm, 1908. Part of: A Posy. Vellum-bound sketchbook containing leaves with an index at the end. Cover with brown leather ornamentation and remains of vellum closure straps.  \nInscription(s): Recto, upper right; watercolour; 107. Recto; watercolour; ....Not a hare to right the bells / Could she make the harebells / Harebells, harebells, a little / Stands and listens longingly; / Touch you; rose mouth kisses / Is a little child a thing any Child's hand or poet's heart / Let her hear your fairy / Let her hear what poet's voice / Let a child ring the bells / Soft she whispers to the flowers, / \"Let me ring your bonny bells! / No; I'm only a little child, / Let me ring your little bells, / Harebells, blue bells, ring, / Set a-going, little child, / on the whole hillside? / ring, if my darling tried? / child blue-gowned / little hands embrowned / you; ring out! / flower should flout? / make it bloom in song / chimes, delicate ding-dong; / never caught nor sung; / little hares have rung! / bending o'er them there, / I'm a little hare! / but I love you so! / just to say you know!\" / ring again! / the joyance of the strain. / E.H. Hickey.; two vertical columns, column break following 'Set a-going, little child'. Verso; watercolour; And the wild-Roses of the promontory / Around me shuddered in the wind, and shed / Their petals of pale red. / There was an old belief that in the embers / Of all things their primordial form exists, / And cunning alchemists / Could recreate the Rose with all its members / From its own ashes, but without the bloom, / Without the lost perfume, / Ah me! what wonder-working, occult science / Can from the ashes in our hearts once more / The Rose of youth restore? / Longfellow / Palingenesis. / And the rose, like a nymph to the bath addressed, / Which unveiled the depth of her glowing breast, / Till, fold after fold, to the fainting air / The soul of her beauty and love lay bare; / Shelley / The Sensitive / Plant."]
