          ["Maiolica. Two-handled spouted jar. Unknown, Tuscany, Umbria or Lazio. Bulbous body narrowing sharply towards the flat base, with short cylindrical neck and two broad strap handles. At centre front there is a straight, upward-sloping spout with horns above, four spots below, and a stag on each side, applied in relief. The spout is decorated to resemble a buffalo's head. The other side is decorated with a stylised flower with two peacock's tail eye motifs in its centre. The handles are flanked by two sets of three vertical manganese lines enclosing three wavy stems with leaves at intervals. The lower part is encircled by an undulating spray of leaves between horizontal manganese bands, and the neck by slanting spaced leaves between pairs of manganese horizontal bands. On the handles, there are alternate groups of manganese and green horizontal lines, flanked, at the bottom, by two addorsed C-shaped strokes. Pale red earthenware, the interior lead-glazed brownish-yellow, the exterior tin-glazed greyish-white; base unglazed. Painted in manganese and pale green. Height, whole, 20.3 cm, diameter, base, 14.3 cm, width, whole, 31.8 cm, circa 1400-1450. Late Medieval"]
