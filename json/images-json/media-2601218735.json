          ["Vessel. Clay beaker, with black top decoration. Production Place: Egypt, Nubia (Southern Egypt/Sudan). Find Spot: Abydos Egypt; grave 4. Kerma beaker, with black top decoration. The vessel is made from Nile Silt clay and has very thin walls, measuring from 2-5 mm in thickness. The rim is asymmetrical and the interior was smoothed with fingers, and burnished (rubbed with a hard object horizontally). Outside there is a red wash on the lower section of the pot which was then polished. This type of ware is called red and black. This vessel came from the grave of a Nubian living in Egypt who belonged to a group of people called the Kerma culture. Only a few familes of the Kerma people found their way into Egypt. It is therefore of interest that they brought pottery with them, along with other goods, but chose a traditional Egyptian manner of burial. The base is rounded. The pot is complete, which is remarkable given its fragile structure. Clay, handmade, burnished and polished, diameter 14.2 cm, height, 11.7, cm, ca 1785-1650 BC. Thirteenth Dynasty; Middle Kingdom; Second Intermediate period."]
