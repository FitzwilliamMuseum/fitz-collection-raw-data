          ["Ka - Ryôgoku kawa. Kunisada, Utagawa (Japanese, 1786-1865). Colour print from woodblocks. Uchiwa, 223 x 296. Signed: Toyokuni ga in toshidama cartouche. Block-cutter: hori Take (Yokokawa Takejirô). Publisher: Jôshûya Kinzô. Censor’s date seal: horse kiwame. 1858. Ukiyo-e. Notes: From an untitled set of four prints depicting the four seasons, which were intended to be mounted as the type of non-folding fans called uchiwa. Traces of yellow-coloured paper used to mount these examples in the past remain around the edge of the sheets. The tradition of designing prints to decorate fans probably began in the second quarter of the eighteenth century. The blocks were rounded at the edges and cut away at the bottom where the bamboo ribs of the support joined the handle. Faint indentations from the ribs can be seen on these prints. As fans tended to be used, worn out and then discarded, relatively few fan prints have survived. Those that remain are normally examples that were never mounted, such as those bound in a fan-seller’s sample book. This series is notable for the way Kunisada has portrayed complex pictorial space in the awkward confines of the uchiwa format. Each print has a subtitle giving the location in Edo and a poem (senryû) commenting on the scene. In this print a woman has just crossed Yanagi Bridge over the Kanda River on her way back from the bathhouse. She clasps her cotton summer robe (yukata) under her arm, combs her hair and holds between her teeth a ‘bran bag’ (nuka-bukuro), which was used in the manner of soap to clean the skin. The sign on the right with the common advertising slogan, Funayado — senkyaku banrai (Boat-inn — thousands of customers, ten thousands of visits), belongs to one of the restaurants that provided boat-service, either for picnics on the river or to take people from the busy entertainment district of Ryôgoku up the Sumida River to the Yoshiwara. The water-taxis (chokibune) used for this purpose can be seen on the river in the background.
