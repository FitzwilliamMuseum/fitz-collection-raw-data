It has shallow straight sides, a fluted candlestick with integral nozzle at the back, with two raised straight-sided rings in front of it enclosing respectively a cylindrical pounce pot with a pierced convex top, and a cylindrical ink well with a central circular aperture; both with a slightly projecting upper edge. The outer edge of the stand has a yellow ground. The flat base of the interior is decorated with three floral sprays and two sprigs. The candlestick has a yellow ground and gilded details. All the edges are banded in gold, and there are touches of gilding on the lion's paws. The pounce pot has a yellow ground and two shaped reserves with gilded frames, one enclosing an actor(?) standing in a landscape with a sphere on a pedestal, the other, a seated woman playing a lute or guitar in a landscape with an urn on a pedestal. There are gold bands round the base and upper edge, and a circle in the centre. The inkwell is decorated to match. In one reserve an actor(?) leans against a pedestal in a landscape, and in the other, a woman stands in a landscape with an urn on a pedestal. The top is decorated with five different floral sprigs. There are gold bands round the base and upper edge, and around the central aperture.
