          ["English Delftware. Plate. Unidentified Liverpool pottery. Circular with a wide almost flat rim, shallow curved sides and flat centre, standing on a footrim. The front is painted overall with a rural scene. On the left, is a tree growing out of a rock on which leans a man playing a horn, who is watched by a standing shepherd, both wearing broad-brimmed hats, jackets, breeches, stockings and shoes. Further to the right are two ill-defined animals, perhaps a goat or sheep and a cat or fox with a large insect flying above them. The rim is encircled by a red-brown band. There is one large and one small peg mark on the reverse of the rim. Buff earthenware, press-moulded, tin-glazed bluish-white, and painted in blue and red-brown. Height, whole, 2.3 cm, diameter, whole, 21.7 cm, circa 1750-1760. Rococo. Production Note: Although the figures are European, the asymmetrical design was strongly influenced by Oriental porcelain, as was the red-brown rim, often a feature of Chinese dishes and plates.
