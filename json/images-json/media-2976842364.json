          ["Sculpture/relief. The Holy Family and the Miraculous Cure of the Robber's Child. Fanelli, Francesco (Italian, 1577-1661/64). The Virgin, with the nude Child on her knee supported by her left hand, is seated on the right, her head turned in profile to the left. Her right hand points to the bowl of water on the floor in front of her. Beside the bowl kneels a woman holding the naked child of the robber in her left arm over the bowl and dipping her right hand into the water; she gazes at the Virgin's face. Behind this group in low relief is the kitchen fire and chimney, with the platters on an adjoining shelf and a pot hangs over the fire. To the left of the kneeling woman is the bearded St Joseph, leaning on his staff, turning his head over his shoulder to talk to the robber, who stands pointing to his breast with his left hand (his right arm is lost). A sword hangs by his side, a dog is curled up asleep at his feet; a tree closes the composition on his right. Copper alloy, probably brass, cast in high relief, height 17.0 cm, length 24.5 cm, circa 1600-1700. Production Note: Previously attributed to Vincezo Danti (1530-1576) and to Ferdinando Tacca (1619-1686). The latter by Anthony Radcliffe. Fanelli was born in Florence in 1577, and was last documented in England in 1641."]
