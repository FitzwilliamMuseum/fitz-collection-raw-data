          ["Cup and saucer. New Hall Porcelain Factory, Staffordshire. Bute shape cup with oval ring handle. Circular saucer with curved sides, standing on a footring. The interior of the cup is decorated at the bottom with a row of red grasses, and round the rim with two narrow red lines under which are four inverted hearts with a circle below. The exterior is decorated with a continuous Chinese scene: two fuzzy black bushes behind a red fence; a woman wearing green and puce clothing, stands holding a sceptre; a spiky black bush and a flowering tree; a boy dressed in green and dark puce who is trying to catch a butterfly; two black bushes flanking a flowering tree; a standing man dressed in blue, and another black bush. The ground is indicated by horizontal red strokes. On the back of the handle in puce are five dots, a stylized leaf, a vertical stroke, and at the lower end two leaves. The saucer is decorated inside with a Chinese scene with spiky black rocks, a flowering shrub and flowering tree; a boy holding up arms to a butterfly, and a man and woman standing side by side, dressed similarly to those on the cup. The border is similar to that on the cup with six heart motifs. Pattern 421.
