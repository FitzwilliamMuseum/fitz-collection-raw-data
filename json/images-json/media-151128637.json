          ["Sculpture. Figure group and base. A Poet's Monument attended by Two Female Mourners. Boizot, Louis Simon (French, 1743-1809). Off centre of the group stands an altar surmounted by an urn, the front of the former bearing a tablet inscribed with the letters D.O.M. over a three line illegible inscription, and below it, a winged lyre and foliage. A veiled but demi-nude mourning female figure wearing a medallion with the portrait of a young man on a chain around her neck, is standing on its right side, fastening a garland of roses onto the urn. To the left stands a young girl playing the flute, and holding in her right hand a circlet of pine which she is about to place on the altar. The base is oval and painted pale grey. It has a row of beading round the upper moulding and stylised leaves round the lower moulding. Between them is a vertical area broken by four projecting pilasters. On the former there are alternating anthemions and palmettes, and on each of the latter, a rosette, all in relief, and gilt. Production Place: Colmar, Paris. Terracotta, on contemporary painted and parcel-gilt wood base (A). Height, terracotta, 36.5 cm, width, terracotta base, 36.5 cm, height, wood base, 7.5 cm, length, wood base, 42.0 cm, depth, wood base, 24.0 cm, 1790. Neoclassical. Louis XVI.
