          ["Figure. Girl representing Asia from a set of Continents or Four Quarters of the Globe. Derby Porcelain Factory, England. The approximately circular base has incurved sides with three kidney-shaped holes between scrolls on each side, and an asymmetrical cartouche at the front inscribed ‘ASIA’ in gold. The girl stands in front of a recumbent camel with its head on the viewer’s right. She stands on her left leg with her right foot resting on a stone a little higher. She looks towards her left, and holds a bunch of red berries in her left hand which is stretched out a little away from her side, and in her right holds up to shoulder level, a small flaming vase. She has black hair and ruddy cheeks. On her head she has a pink cloth and a garland of fruit and foliage. She wears a shoulderless white dress with a jewelled turquoise stomacher, and a white drape patterned with red and blue flowers and gold foliage, and lined with pink. The camel is white with one black hoof, a pale orange muzzle, and black irises to its eyes. On the front of the base there are four groups of applied flowers: blue, dark pink, and orange, and dark pink all with yellow centres, and leaves. Across the back of the base there is a large group of blue and yellow flowers and leaves. The base is picked out in pink, turquoise, and gold. Soft-paste porcelain slip-cast with moulded details, painted over lead-glaze in blue, green, turquoise, yellow, pale orange, orange, pink, red, and black enamels, and gilt. The closed underside has three indistinct patch makers and a circular ventilation hole. Height, whole, 21.5 cm, width, whole, 11.5 cm, circa 1780. Rococo."]
