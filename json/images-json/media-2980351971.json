The second tier is cylindrical with one large and ten smaller holes, and a protruding cylinder at the bottom which fits into the top of the dome of the bowl. The third tier is a smaller with one large and six smaller holes, and a protruding cylinder which fits into the second tier. The lower part of the bowl and the second tier are decorated with floral sprays and insects. The domed and pierced area has four horizontal bands of formal ornament, and there are different formal borders round the upper edge of the second stage, and the upper and lower edges of the third stage. Buff earthenware, thrown in three sections, pierced, tin-glazed slightly greenish, bluish-white, and painted in blue; the glaze has been wiped off footring and the lower edge of the two separate tiers, height, whole, 26.7 cm, circa 1780-1790.
