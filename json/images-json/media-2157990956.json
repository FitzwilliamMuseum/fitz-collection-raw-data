          ["Flattened flask with bamboo design. Unknown pottery, Songjong-ri kilns. This typical seventeenth-century flask has a flattened moon-shaped body, narrow waisted neck and broad oval foot that was separately made and joined to the body. Each side is painted in underglaze iron-oxide with short stems of bamboo in shaded tones of brown. The glaze is tinged with blue. The footring shows traces of fine sand from the firing support. Porcelain, moulded, luted, painted in iron-brown, and glazed, height 20.1 cm, diameter, rim, 3.7 cm, diameter, foot, 8.8 cm, circa 1630-1660. Choson Dynasty. Production Note: Such flasks were probably used at outings and picnics. This one was probably made in the kilns at Sondong-ri which were active from 1640 to 1649, or at Songjong-ri, around 1650."]
