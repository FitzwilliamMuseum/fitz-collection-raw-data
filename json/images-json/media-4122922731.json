          ["Weapons. Sword/Rapier. Unknown production, Possibly made in Germany in the Spanish style. Small button-like pommel, fluted on top, with a sharp collar underneath. Very short barrel-shaped grip, spirally fluted: only the dark wood case of which remains, bearing clear imprints of stout twisted wire having been in the flutes. There is a strong, faceted collar of steel at top and bottom. Widely-arched knuckle-guard of circular section, very wide straight quillons of the same section, the tips decorated with a double encircling incised line; strong cusped ecusson and branches. There are two large shell-guards, the divisions between which, below the quillons, are filled each with a large loop flanked by a smaller one on either side of it. The inner shell is plain, but its outer one is crudely chiselled with leafy patterns, above which, separated by a straight band, is possibly a lion passant, between foliage. Long, very slender blade of deep diamond section, with a very long ricasso and a deep narrow fuller at the forte. On each side, in this fuller, is a legend: on the obverse, 'XX MEV . SINNAL . SANTISMO . CRVCIFICIO XX' and on the reverse, 'XXX ENRICO COLL ESPADERO EN ALAMANIA XX'. This is the name of the German Hadesmid Heinrich Coll written in Spanish form. The sword presumably made in Germany (Solingen) for the Spanish market. The mark of the crucifix is on the ricasso. Leather scabbard with locket of chased steel. Norman hilt type not specified. Steel sword, cast, with fluted, incised and chiselled decoration, length, whole, 112.5 cm, length, blade, 95.8 cm, width, blade at hilt, 1.4 cm, circa 1650-1680."]
