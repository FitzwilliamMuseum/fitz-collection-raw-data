          ["Usukumo. Gakutei, Yashima (Japanese, 1786(?)-1868). Surimono. Colour print from woodblocks, with metallic pigment and blind embossing. Early 1820s. Poetry by Matsumado no Chie and Bunbunsha. circa 1820 to circa 1823. Ukiyo-e. Notes: From the series of legendary heroines Katsushikaren gakumen fujin awase (Framed paintings of women for the Katsushika Group). The Katsushika poetry group’s symbol is incorporated into the decorative frames around the ‘paintings’. Usukumo was the name adopted by Lady Fujitsubo in the Tale of Genji after she entered a nunnery. Daughter of a former Emperor, she was the consort of Genji’s father, Emperor Kiritsubo, and the first woman that Genji fell in love with. She secretly bore him a son, Reizei, who was declared Crown Prince and later succeeded Genji’s father as Emperor. It was only after Fujitsubo’s death that Reisei learned that Genji was his true father."]
