          ["Print album. Valentine card. Comic valentine on the subject of the crinoline. Unknown publisher. 32mo-size white wove paper with hand-coloured wood engraving of a lady with a large nose wearing a veiled bonnet and a crinoline, the hooped cage and her drawers visible. A printed verse below: \"A faithful lover humbly begs, / To offer tender suit / _Don't_ wear that bird cage round your legs, / Or he the moon must shoot.\". The inside pages are blank. Mounted on the same album leaf as other similar cards, all of the same size and relating to the subject of crinolines. Style and font of verse the same as P.14412-R-3. The same verse and similar illustration seen on another card, P.14412-R-8, in the same album. It seems quite likely that the series of valentines on the subject of crinolines which are mounted together in album P.14412-R were purchased by Glaisher from the Actons of Brighton in 1924. In a letter to Miss Catherine Parsons dated 19th November 1924, Glaisher states: 'I am enclosing some valentines sent me on appro [approval] from Miss Acton of Brighton: they are 3/- each or £2.10 for the lot. They all relate to the crinoline period 1860 ... There are some duplicates tht [that] you could relieve me of if I take the set which may be the best to do.'. Fitzwilliam Museum, MS 905-1985, 19th November, 1924, letter to Miss Catherine Parsons. Wood engraving, hand colouring, probably 1850-1860."]
