          ["Armour. Leg-defence for the right foreleg of a horse. Unknown production, Germany. Formed of twelve downward-overlapping lames curved to the front of the horse's upper foreleg and shoulder, and increasing in width to its upper end. The upper edge of the top lame is slightly convex with gently rounded corners. It has a file-roped inward turn accompanied by a recessed border containing nine holes for lining-rivets, all of which are now missing. The lower edge of the bottom lame also has a file-roped inward turn. The outer ends of the lame are each pierced with a rivet-hole that formerly served to secure a strap around the rear of the horse's leg. The first to eleventh lames have bevelled lower edges. The lames are connected to one another at their outer ends by modern, round-headed lining-rivets with internal washers that are variously square, pentagonal, hexagonal or circular. The lames were further connected to one another by a pair of internal leathers located a short distance within the sliding-rivets. The leathers were attached to each lame by single externally-flush rivets, all of which are now missing. Steel, formed of twelve downward-overlapping lames curved to the front of the horse's upper foreleg and shoulder, and increasing in width to its upper end; hammered, shaped, riveted, with a recessed border, file-roped and bevelled decoration. Height, whole, 25.6 cm, maximum, width, whole, 26.2 cm, maximum, depth, whole, 22.1 cm, maximum, weight, whole, 1.07 kg, circa 1550. Provenance: From the armoury of the Princes Radziwill, Castle of Niescwiez, Poland. Production Notes: The leg-defence originally had a `black from the hammer' finish, now cleaned to a mottled bright finish with light to heavy pitting overall. Similar leg-defences for a horse are depicted in Hans Burkmeier's Triumph of Maximilian. Forming a pair or near pair to M.9-1945."]
