Rectangular, almost flat copper plaque with arched top, the white preparation enamelled in blue, green, yellow, brownish-mulbery, pale purple, a little red,  black and white and gilded. The drawing appears black through the white preparation. The flesh is white over black with a pale mauve wash applied over parts of the faces and limbs.The circular jewels are foiled with presumed silver paillons. The surface is slightly rippled and almost mat.The counter-enamel is not visible.\nThe Virgin Mary is seated in the centre, looking down at the dead Christ who lies across her knees with his right arm hanging down, and his left extended but only partly visible. The Virgin’s  right hand is raised, and she supports Christ’s right shoulder with her left hand. Christ’s left hand is held by Mary Magdalen, who stands on the right holding a jar of ointment in her right hand. St John stands on the left looking towards the others. Both he and the Magdalene are shown three-quarter view with their heads in profile. Christ wears a green head band and a brown cloth round his loins. The Virgin has a mulbery halo with gold rays and eight alternately green and blue jewels. She wears a dark blue cloak over a mulbery gown. Mary Magdalene has waist-length pale brown and gold wavy hair, and wears a green turban-like cap, and a pale purple cloak over a green dress. St John has shoulder-length golden hair, and a green halo with six alternately mulberry and blue jewels. wears a mulberry gown and has a pale blue cloth over his right arm. All have white flesh shaded in grey. Behind the figures is a niche with a trefoil arch rising from cylindrical columns with carved capitals and bases. The columns are blue and have three jewels on their capitals and two on their bases. The trefoil arch has a jewel on a trefoil on the two angles. The words ‘O(insert a large n)  OVO AVER’ are inscribed in gold on the wall of the niche. The lower part is scattered with gold dots over a black ground. The area within the trefoil arch is blue.

The frame covers the reverse completely and has  a vertically hinged prop, pierced by two groups of three holes. It is inscribed in black on the left B/55/L.D.C, and on the right 'igi' underlined, and lower down '615' on a tabula ansata with 'Ic.'
