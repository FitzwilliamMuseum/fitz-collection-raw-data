          ["C.32-1954. Provençal Drummer from the Cries de Paris. Meissen Porcelain Factory, Germany. Reinicke, Peter, modeller. The underside of the base is unglazed, and has had the ventilation hole and two firing cracks filled with a brown substance.  The low, irregular four-sided base has a tall tree stump at the back and is decorated with applied leaves and a yellow and a red and white rose at the front. The musician stands on his right leg with his left extended in front. In his left hand he holds a large brown pipe to his lips. In his right hand he holds a brown drum-stick with which he plays on a monstrous white drum decorated with pale brown rope trimmings. The base of the drum rests on the tree-stump, and it is supported by a beige strap which hangs over his left arm. The drummer has thick curly grey hair hanging down to his shoulders. He wears a black three-cornered hat with a gold stud on its left side, a white shirt with ruffles at the wrists, a long white coat with gold buttons; pale yellow breeches with gold bands at the knees; white stockings, and black shoes with gold buckles.  Hard-paste porcelain, press-moulded, and painted overglaze in green, yellow, flesh pink, a little red, beige, brown, and black enamels, and gilt, height 19.5 cm width 12.2 cm, depth 6.5 cm, 1747. Rococo.\n\nC.27-1954: Hurdy-gurdy player. Meissen Porcelain Factory, Germany. Reinicke, Peter, modeller. The unglazed base has a small round ventilation hole near the back. The rounded square low mound base has a tree stump at the back, and is decorated on top with applied leaves, and a red, a yellow and a mauve flower. The hurdy-gurdy player stands on his left foot with right leg forward. He carries a large white hurdy-gurdy outlined in black, and with his right hand turns the handle of the wheel which sounds the strings, while with his left hand he plays upon the keys which stop the strings and thus obtain the notes. He has long brownish-black hair trailing untidily down his back, and wears a black hat with the brim turned up at the sides, a brown waistcoat with gold buttons, a long collarless white coat with two gold buttons at the top of the two back pleats, yellow breeches, white hose, and black shoes with yellow bows. Hard-paste porcelain painted in yellow, green, red, brown, and black enamels, and gilt, height 20.2 cm width 9.5 cm, depth 7 cm, 1745. Rococo."]
