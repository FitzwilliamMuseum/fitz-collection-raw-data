          ["Vessel/Jar. Clay jar, cylindrical, with two handles and vine-leaf, female faces, fish and dot decoration, in red, yellow, black and white. Production Place/Find Spot: Egypt, Nubia. On the shoulder is a vine-leaf motif and on the body are rows of faces, fish, blobs and bands. This type of colourful pottery is typical of that made in Nubia, in particular Meroe during the Roman period. the frontal faces are a typical motif and it has been suggested that here they represent women because their skin is painted pinkish-shite as was the convention for women. Some of the faces are less carefully executed, one is without any pupils for the eyes and several have blurred outlines. the faces have been painted in the following sequence: the yellow on white background first, then the facial features in black and finally a red outline. It has been suggested that the line accross the forehead is a tribal mark; it could also represent a disk worn by the goddess Hathor. This vessel is a vibrant mix of Roman, Nubian and Egyptian motifs. The clay is Nile silt. Clay, wheelmade, painted, height 0.341 m, width 0.212 m, AD 1-100. Roman Period."]
