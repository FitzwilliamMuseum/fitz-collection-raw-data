          ["Weapons. Sword and scabbard, with silvered hilt. Unknown production, Germany or Scandinavia. Flat heart-shaped pommel with strong button at the top and collars below. The grip, bound with steel wire, is vertically grooved with short diagonal grooves between the vertical ones. There are tusk heads top and bottom. Wide, vertically recurved quillons of flat ribbon section (in the plane of the blade) widening at the ends. Large forward ring-guard of similar section, widening at its midpoint and filled with a steel plate pierced with a very delicate pattern of interlinked rings, the whole decorative pattern within a diamond shape with a heart-shaped opening at each of the four point. The entire hilt is covered with a deeply engraved all over floral pattern. Traces of the silver plating which once covered the hilt remain on the ends of the quillons. There is a back-guard in the form of a ring cusped at the midpoint to form a thumb ring. The backs of the guards are undecorated except for a little flower-like figure in each quillon-end. Long tapering blade of flattened diamond section. Blade inscribed GODVERMAGS and ICH W AGS on one side and VERITATEM DILLIGITE on the other. There is a well preserved scabbard of leather over the wood with a long steel chape decorated en suite with the hilt. Near the top is a pocket for a by-knife. The upper past is decorated with tooled lines parallel with the edges. At the point-end of the by-knife pocket are tooled decoration. The upper 5.08 cm (2\") of the scabbard has been cut away, probably to remove a steel locket to match the chape. Steel sword, cast with grooved and pierced decoration, length, whole, 104.0 cm, length, grip, 8.1 cm, length, blade, 88.3 cm, width, blade at hilt, 3.7 cm, width, quillons, 22.3 cm, weight, whole, 1.5 kg, circa 1650.
