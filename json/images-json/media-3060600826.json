His left arm is raised and holds a bunch of grapes. His head is bent and turned to the left as he gazes down at his right hand, which once seems to have held a cup. His hair is entwined with vines. Copper alloy, probably bronze, cast, and polished, height, whole, 50.5 cm, width, whole, 15.5 cm, depth, whole, 17.0 cm, circa 1570-1575. Renaissance.
