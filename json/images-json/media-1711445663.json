          ["Inscription surrounded by floral border: Bluebell. Inscription surrounded by floral border: Lily, Sunflower and Rose. Bicknell, Clarence (British, 1842-1918). Recto; watercolour; \"-The grass in the wood was green; / Today it has all turned blue. / Had any one told me - even a Queen, / I could not have thought it true. / I wonder if I'm awake; / Those trees never used to grow / Bathing their feet in a deep blue lake; / I can't make it out, you know. / I always thought of the sky / High lifted over my head; / So please can you tell me the reason why / It's under my feet instead?\" / But the bellmen of Elfin Town / Ring out a delicated chime; / The world has not turned upside down, / It is only - Bluebell Time. / O.G. Robertson. Verso; watercolour; Lily, fair lily, / Why are you all in white? / \"Child, I was born of the pale moonlight: / Where it fell through the night / Dank and chilly, / And touched with splendour the dreaming earth, / There had I birth.\" / Tall Sunflower, / Where got you your disk of yellow? / \"From the golden sun that laughed as I leapt / To greet him King without fellow! / He passed, but his smile I kept / Through storm and through shower - / A life-long dower.\" / Rose, sweet Rose, / Why is your heart so red? / \"From splendours shed / When the sky was aflame with the sunset light; / The crimson paled, and the day was dead; / But its lustre a rosebud knows / Born that night.\" / M.A. Woods / Flower fancies. Watercolour over graphite on paper, height, leaf, 326 mm, width, leaf, 255 mm, 1908. Part of: A Posy. Vellum-bound sketchbook containing leaves with an index at the end. Cover with brown leather ornamentation and remains of vellum closure straps."]
