        "value": ["Tasset for the right thigh, for field use. Formed of nine, medially-ridged, upward-overlapping lames that widen to its lower end.  The inner end of the first lame projects slightly beyond the inner end of the second lame, and shows evidence of having had a transverse step which has since been hammered out.  The ninth lame has a straight lower edge with rounded corners.  The tasset has file-roped inward turns at its upper and lower edges, and plain, partial inward turns at its inner and outer edges.  The turn at the lower edge is accompanied by a recessed border containing seven modern lining-rivets of which the outer ones are of externally-flush form, and the remainder of brass-capped, round-headed form with square, internal washers.  The upper edges of the second to ninth lames are bevelled and decorated with pairs of incised lines.  The lames are connected to one another at their outer ends by brass-capped, round-headed rivets with square, internal washers.  The rivets that connect the fourth and fifth, the sixth and seventh, and the seventh and eighth lames to one another lack their brass caps.  The lames are further connected to one another at their inner ends and centres by modern internal leathers secured by single rivets.  The rivets are externally-flush, except for those in the ninth lame which are of brass-capped, round-headed form with square internal washers.  The rivets that secure the inner leather to the seventh lame, and the central leather to the first lame have been lost and replaced by split pins.  Modern, brass-capped, round-headed rivets occupy construction-holes in the second to ninth lames, aligning with the rivet-holes for attaching the inner leathers.  The inner ends of the second, fourth, seventh and ninth lames, and the outer ends of the first, fourth, seventh and ninth lames are fitted with modern, externally-flush lining-rivets.  The first lame is fitted with three modern, double-ended, tongued, iron buckles with rectangular hasps having cropped corners.  The buckles are retained by round-headed rivets.  A later hole is pierced between the outer and central buckles. Part of the composite half armour HEN.M.10A-G-1933"]
