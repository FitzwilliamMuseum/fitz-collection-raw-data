        "value": ["A pair of pauldrons and vambraces, for use by a cuirassier. The pauldrons are each formed of nine medially-ridged lames that overlap outwards from the fifth which is shaped to the point of the shoulder.  The first to fifth lames extend inwards over the chest and back.  The fifth lame is expanded downwards to the level of the bottom of the seventh lame at the front, and the bottom of the eighth lame at the rear.  The expanded portions have slightly rounded lower inner corners and are flanged at their outer edges where they overlap the lames beneath them.  The sixth to ninth lames extend only to the inside of the arm.  The expanded portions of the fifth lame are each decorated at their centres with ten round-headed rivets in rosette formation enclosing a scored flowerhead with nine slender petals.  The first to fifth lames are connected to one another by modern round-headed rivets with internal washers at their rear ends, by modern internal leather at their front ends, and by two further modern internal leathers at their centres.  The fifth to ninth lames are connected to one another and to the turner beneath them by three modern internal leathers of which the rear two are a continuation of the central leathers that connect the first to fifth lames.  The leathers of the right pauldron are missing.  The tubular turner has an inward-overlapping join at the rear secured by two externally-flush rivets.  The lower edge of the turner is bordered by a raised rib, the hollowed underside of which locks over and rotates on the outward flange upper edge of the upper cannon of the vambrace.  The tubular upper cannon, which is considerably shorter at the inside than the outside of the arm, has an inward-overlapping join at the rear secured by two externally-flush rivets.  The upper cannon is connected to the lower cannon by a couter of five lames that overlap outwards from the central one which is shaped to the point of the elbow and has a small oval wing at the front.  The wing has a slight central pucker at its inner end, and is cut with a semi-circular notch at the top and bottom of its outer edge.  The lames of the couter are connected to one another and to the upper and lower cannons by modern round-headed rivets at their outer ends.  The tubular lower cannon is formed of a short inner plate and a longer outer plate.  The former fits within the latter.  The two plates are connected to one another by an internal hinge at the rear, and fastened by a hinged hasp and turning-pin at the front.  Fitted within the upper and lower cannons are a series of eleven inward-overlapping lames that protect the inside of the elbow.  The lames are connected to one another at their outer ends by externally-flush rivets, and connected to the upper and lower cannons medially by modern internal leathers. The pauldrons and vambraces have heavy roping and their edges and decorative details were originally heat-blued against a bright ground. Part of the composite three-quarter armour HEN.M.15A-F-1933."]
