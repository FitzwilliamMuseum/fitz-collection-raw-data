        "value": ["From a full set of 78 tarot cards of the Piedmont type (Tarocco Piemontese), made in Milan by L. Lamperti. One of 22 trump cards. A hand-coloured woodcut with the backs of the cards folded over the edges of the fronts to form a border that is typical of Italian cards. A female figure wears a crown and sits on a throne. She holds a sceptre in her left hand and a shield bearing a simplified version of the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia (1815-1866), which features a double-headed eagle carrying in its left talon a sword and sceptre (like the one held by the Empress) and an orb in its right. This is possibly a depiction of Maria Ann of Savoy (1803-1884), wife of the Emperor of Austria, Ferdinand I (1793-1875). Maria Ann was crowned Empress of Austria in 1836. The word, MILANO is printed on a swag below the Empress's throne. Milan was the capital city of the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia between 1815â€“1859. Printed above and below: III; L'IMPERATRICE. On the verso is a woodcut printed in red ink and hand-coloured in yellow of a winged female figure holding aloft the Iron Crown of Lombardy, the word, MILANO printed below. The Tarocco pack consists of 78 cards: a trump suit of 22 cards, numbered from 0 to 21, and four 14-card suits of swords (spades), batons (bastoni), cups (coppe), and coins (denari). Each suit has a King (Re), Queen (Regina), Knight (Cavaliere) and Jack or Knave (Fante). There are similar sets in the collection of the British Museum. See: 1904,0511.38.1-78 and 1896,0501.120."]
