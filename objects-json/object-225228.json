        "value": ["Fragment of a woodcut on paper printed in brown ink of a design for the back of a playing card. There are losses along the upper and left edges. A central rectangular frame contains a group of three nude mythological figures; Mars wearing a plumed helmet is seated with the child Cupid at his knee, who holds an arrow and Venus stands to the right, her right hand resting on Mars's shoulders and her left hand at her groin. The area behind the figures has been hand-coloured in black ink, indicating that possibly the whole design would originally have been coloured. The central image is enclosed within a border of a repeated pattern of small diamond shapes. One of four impressions of the same design with only P.14641-R(2) complete. The mount is inscribed in graphite at lower centre and lower right: 'Playing Cards / Italian, 16th Century / Given by / C.Fairfax Murray, Esq. / Dec.1916'. A handwritten inscription on the verso of the mount board indicates that the four designs were exhibited in the Print Room from October 1950-January 1951, probably in the exhibition of Early Italian Engravings."]
