        "value": ["Tasset for right thigh, for field use. Formed of ten medially-ridged, upward-overlapping lames that widen to its lower end. The inner edge of the tasset is cut away in a shallow, concave curve. The tenth lame, which is deeper than the rest, has a slightly convex lower edge with rounded corners. The lower edge has a strongly file-roped inward turn that merges into plain, partial inward turns at the corners. The roped turn is accompanied by a recessed border enclosed above by a plain, raised rib of V-section. The lateral edges of the tasset have plain, partial inward turns accompanied by a recessed border. The border of the tenth lame is occupied by seven round-headed lining-rivets, all of which are of brass with square or circular internal washers, except for the central one which is of brass-capped iron and lacks its internal washer. The borders of the lateral edges are pierced with holes for a further ten lining-rivets, all now missing. The holes occupy the inner and outer ends of the first, third, fifth, seventh and ninth lames. A similar hole pierced at the outer end of the eighth lame probably represents a later addition. The upper edges of all ten lames of the tasset of the second to tenth lames are also decorated medially with V-shaped nicks. The lames are connected to one another at their inner and outer ends by modern brass-capped, round-headed rivets. That which connects the fourth and fifth lames at their inner ends is fitted with an octagonal internal washer. Those which connect the first and second lames at their outer ends, and the second and third lames at both their inner and outer ends have been replaced by round-headed rivets of solid brass. The lames were further connected to one another at their centres by an internal leather secured by single internally-flush rivets, except at the tenth lame where it was secured by a pair of brass-capped, round-headed rivets with circular internal washers. The washer of the outer rivet is now missing, as is the rivet that connects the leather to the first lame. The leather itself is now represented only by small fragments. The first lame is fitted with three modern, double-ended, tongued, iron suspension-buckles. The buckles have rounded rectangular loops and rectangular hasps with cropped corners and notched sides. They are each retained by single round-headed brass rivets. Holes pierced just above and medial to the inner and outer buckles respectively, probably represent earlier suspension-points. Part of the composite armour HEN.M.14A-L-1933."]
