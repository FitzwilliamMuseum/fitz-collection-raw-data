Formed of a single plate front and rear, each of which is flanged upwards at the neck-opening where it has a plain inward turn bordered by lining-rivets.  The medially-ridged front plate slopes in slightly to a low cusp at each side and then more sharply beneath them to a central point.  The front and rear plates are connected to one another at the left side by a modern round-headed rivet with a square internal washer, and fastened to one another at the right side by a modern, asymmetrical, mushroom-shaped stud and keyhole slot.  The collar was originally equipped with integral spaudlers connected by three internal leathers:  two in the rear plate and one in the front.  Each leather was attached to the collar by a pair of externally-flush rivets, except for the front one at the right side which would have been buttoned onto a single internal stud.  Some of the rivets are preserved with fragments of their leathers.  Later pairs of holes have been pierced just to the outside of the original pairs of holes at the left end of the rear plate.  The rear of the pair of holes for the attachment of the central leather at each side is now used to attach a modern suspension-strap for a pauldron. Part of the composite three-quarter armour HEN.M.19A-G-1933."]
