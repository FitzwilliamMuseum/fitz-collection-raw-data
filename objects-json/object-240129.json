This work features the foliage and tree trunk as reproduced in Watson's print); a version with the title 'L'Ã‰te' (Summer) and with a pendant, Autumn was sold at the Matthiesen Gallery, London, 1987 (Jeffares, J.21.1309. This work also features the foliage and trunks, but to a lesser degree)) and a copy sold at Sotheby's, London in 1975 (Jeffares, J.21.1314)). Half-length, to waist, female figure facing left, head turned to address the spectator. She wears rustic dress with light-coloured chemise and bodice over with lacing at the front. She holds a peach in her right hand and carries several others in a cloth/apron in front. A shadowy background with a tree trunk visible behind and to the right. The mezzotints by James Watson and James Wilson (Chaloner Smith, 22; see P.15110-R) after this work are known by the title, 'Peach Girl', but the original work has been associated subsequently with Carriera's several allegorical representations of The Four Seasons, as a personification of Summer (The Matthiesen Gallery assigned the title, 'An allegory of Summer, a girl holding peaches', to the work). An old inscription of 'Autumn' on the verso of this print also relates to this idea."]
