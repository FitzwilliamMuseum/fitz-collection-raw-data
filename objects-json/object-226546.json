S.]. On the first day, Albemarle with sixty ships attacked the Dutch fleet of ninety, and if not victorious was not defeated. The next morning the attack was renewed, and several English ships being disabled, Albemarle retired towards the Thames. In the evening of the third day he was reinforced by Prince Rupert's squadron, and, though still inferior, renewed the engagement. On the fourth day he again attacked the Dutch, and the fight continued till seven in the evening, when both parties were concealed from each other by a dense fog. Both sides claimed a victory, which belonged to neither. Both suffered greatly, and perhaps in an equal degree, and De Witt's honourable avowal was, \"If the English were beaten, their defeat did them more honour than all their former victories; their own (the Dutch) fleet could never have been brought on after the first day's fight, and he believed none but theirs (the English) could.\" The Admiral taken was Sir George Ayscue who having stranded in \"The Prince\" was taken prisoner and his vessel burnt."]
