Sticks of heavy pierced, carved and gilt mother-of-pearl; guards of pierced, carved and gilt mother-of-pearl (14+2) rivet set with a garnet paste.  Front:  Probably a mythological coronation scene set on a pedestal with a blue rug, with an old, white-bearded man in a red ermine-edged robe in the centre surrounded by women in classical dress.  A woman behind him is holding a crown, two in front of him have torches, and one is kneeling holding a large candlestick.  Two women on the left are stepping up to a pedestal and others are making music in the background are three women with food and water.  Behind a curtain a woman is shaking a cushion and there is a steaming pot; a human face appears in the steam.  Green curtains and bushes flank the scene and there is broad scrolling foliage with a women sitting in between on either side.  Some areas are filled with trellis patterns or striations and top and lower edging are of gold foil.  Back:  there is a mountainous landscape with a castle in the centre and in front of its rocks, trees, a building, a man fishing and four women.  Sticks:  Four sticks at a time form three rococo cartouches.  The central on contains a couple dancing; the left and right enclose a flower arrangement on stools.  There is a uniform background of scrolls and leaves on all sticks.  The lower parts of the sticks show different patterns, decorated symmetrically.  The reverse has three oval cartouches of leaves, the central one with sprays of flowers, the outer ones with leaf crowns..  Guards:  The shoulders are decorated in a similar way with a big flower on the bottom and one with two blossoms on top.  The guards proper of the front guard has a gentleman standing on a gold bordered panel with scrolling ornaments and under leaves and a flower.  The guard proper of the back guard has a lady standing on a panel of scrolls and leaves; above her there are scrolling leaves and a flower and a pelmet and tassels."]
