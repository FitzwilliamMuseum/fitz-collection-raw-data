        "value": ["Pot helmet, for use by an harquebusier. Formed of a skull, a pivoted peak with a triple-bar face-defence, a neck-guard of two upward-overlapping lames, and a pair of pendant cheek-pieces.  The deep, hemispherical skull is of great weight, and rises to a low medial ridge.  Its lower edge is pierced with numerous holes for lining-rivets, some of which are occupied by round-headed rivets.  The moderately broad, flat, pointed peak is formed in two pieces:  a brow-plate with backward-projecting arms, and the peak proper with a flanged rear edge that is riveted within the former.  Riveted within the underside of the peak is a face-defence formed of three vertical bars of square section that curve in towards one another at their lower end where they are united in a hammer-welded quadrangular point.  The right bar has broken through at its point of union.  The break shows evidence of an untidy soldered repair that has itself broken.  The obtusely-pointed lower edge of the neck-defence is embossed with a series of simulated round-headed lining-rivets.  The cheek-pieces, which are each suspended from the lower edge of the skull by a pair of internal leathers , have convex front and rear edges that converge at their lower ends.  They are each pierced at their centres with seven circular ventilation-holes in rosette-formation.  The front edge of the peak and the lower edge of the neck-defence have plain inward turns.   The lateral edges of the cheek-pieces and the neck-defence have plain partial inward turns."]
