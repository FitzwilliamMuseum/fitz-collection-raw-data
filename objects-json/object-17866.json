        "value": ["Collar, for field use, in the North Italian style. Formed of two upward-overlapping lames front and rear.  The top lame in each instance has a prominent, file-roped, inward turn at its upper edge.  The turn in each  is bordered by five small, round-headed lining-rivets with circular, internal washers.  The bottom lame in each instance is considerably deeper than the first lame.  The front one has a strongly convex lower edge, and the rear one, a slightly convex lower edge with strongly rounded corners.  The lower edge in each instance has a plain, partial inward turn accompanied by a recessed border.  The borders of the front and rear lames contain, respectively, seven and five round-headed lining-rivets of brass.  The upper edge of the bottom lame in each instance is flanged upwards to receive the top lame.  It is bordered by a single incised line, now much worn.  The lames were originally connected to one another by three internal leathers front and rear.  The leathers were retained by single, externally-flush rivets in the top lame and single, round-headed, brass rivets with circular, internal washers in the bottom lame.  The central leathers have been cut from straps.  The front one shows holes for the tongue of a buckle.  The outer leathers are missing.  To compensate for their loss, the lames have now been rigidly secured to one another by round-headed brass rivets with circular, internal washers occupying the elongated leathering-holes in the top-lame and the overlying construction-holes in the bottom lame.  The latter would originally have been occupied by independent, purely decorative round-headed rivets.  The front and rear sections of the collar are connected to one another at the left side by a rectangular hinge with cropped corners secured within the top lame by a pair of rivets front and rear.  The rivets at the front are externally-flush, while the rivets at the rear are later replacements with small, flattened round heads.  The front and rear sections of the collar are fastened to one another at   the right side by means of a mushroom-shaped stud of brass riveted to the bottom rear lame engaging a keyhole-slot in the corresponding front lame, and a small, plain stud riveted to a tongue-like projection of the top rear lame engaging a circular hole in the corresponding front  lame.  Secured by a brass-capped, round-headed rivet at the top of each shoulder of the bottom rear lame is a buff-leather strap for the attachment of the pauldrons. Part of the composite half armour HEN.M.13A-F-1933."]
