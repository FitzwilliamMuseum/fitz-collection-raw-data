So far as can be seen, bearing in mind the set is not complete, the plates have been printed in order, with the exception of the sixth sheet (which has three plates instead of two): plate nos. 18, 19 & 26. The latter is not a numbered impression, which might explain why it is out of sequence. The sheets have two small holes at the centre of the left-hand edge, where they were once bound together. The pages are watermarked with a 'Pro Patria' and the initials JV (the maker Jean Villedary? This would be consistent with dates Overton owned the plates, ca.1665-1700)."]
