Cryer, for his Services as captain of No. 1 Division., circular disc in silver frame with suspension loop, 47mm.  Bought from Christopher Eimer.Making Place Academy was a progressive commercial college at Making Place Hall, Soyland,  near Halifax, Yorks., opened in January 1832 by William Dove (1807-65) for 12 pupils. The school may have been involved with the introduction of Pitman's shorthand. Mrs Dove attended to the domestic tasks at the school. At one time, there were 200 pupils  from all parts of the world  and a staff of 20. Prime Minister Herbert Henry Asquith was an old boy of the school. After Dove's death, T. K. Holdsworth ran the school, but the establishment declined and it closed in 1880"]
