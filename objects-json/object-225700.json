This comes from \"The principles of English Grammar\" by Wm. Lennie (1779-1852), an Edinburgh teacher of English. Lennie was best known for the above book first published in 1816, reprinted throughout the 19th C, 93rd edition in 1894.\n\nThe third section contains a structure with a perching bird flanked by a caged bird and a tree.\n\nThe final section is inscribed \"Marcia Lockyer/Elmham 1837\".\n\nMarcia Lockyer was born 2nd Oct. 1823, baptised 2 Nov. 1823 at All Saints,  Kingston upon Thames. \nMarcia married Robert Bradfield (baptised 14th Nov. 1824, Elmham, Norfolk) on the 1st. Dec 1844 in Chesterton, Cambridge.. According to the 1841 census his parents, Robert and Frances, were running an inn, The KIing's Head, on the Holt Rd. Elmham. Possibly Marcia had been in service in Elmham, even in the King's Head or her father (a bricklayer) had found work in the area."]
