Admiral Sir Peter Parker (1721-1811) was a Naval officer and early patron of Lord Nelson. He was also MP for Seaford, East Sussex. He is seen full length turned towards the left, facing front, his right hand holding his Admiral's hat held out towards the left and his left hand resting on the hilt of his sword. He is portrayed at the Portsmouth Battery standing in front of a cannon, which points out to sea to the left of the picture. His flagship, the 'Royal William' is seen in the background on the sea to the left. The 'Royal William' was guardship (a warship employed as a stationary guard in a port or harbour) at Portsmouth in 1799. The Union flag flying at the main mast signifies Parker's rank as Admiral of the Fleet, a position which he attained on 16th September, 1799.
