        "value": ["From an incomplete pack of 42 playing-cards with French suits. There are 10 missing cards: Ten of Clubs, Four of Clubs, Nine of Spades, Ace of Spades, Queen of Diamonds, Three of Diamonds, Two of Diamonds, Ten of Hearts, Nine of Hearts, Ace of Hearts. Woodcut with hand colouring on pasteboard. Contained inside a pasteboard box covered in a design of bamboo strips and black tape. A double-ended court card with a decorative strip dividing the two ends. The Queen is bare-headed and wears a red cloak with a yellow fur collar. she holds a book in her right hand. The French suit mark of spades is printed to the left of the Queen's head. The back is printed with a pattern of dots and half circles with dots at the centre in blue ink. A stamp found on the Jack of Hearts is closely comparable to that of the tax stamp of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (Naples and Sicily) circa 1830, suggesting that the cards were probably printed in France for use in Naples/Sicily, as packs were stamped in the country of use, not in the country of production."]
