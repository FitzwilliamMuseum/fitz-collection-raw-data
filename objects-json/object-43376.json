The underside is unglazed and rough, and has a large circular ventilation hole through which the interior fo the figure is visible.  The roughly square base is edged by frilled scrolls flanking a pierced shell asymmetrically placed at the front. At the back it rises up into a tree stump which is pierced by a circular hole to take an attachment, probably a candle branch. Applied to the top of the base there is a group of three flowers and three leaves, and a group of two flowers and two leaves.  The young man is seated on the stump with his right leg extended to the side and his left foot forward. He turns his head to his left, and with his left hand caresses the head of a dog which has its front paws on his left thigh. He holds his other hand over his right thigh. He has brown hair and eyes, pale pink cheeks, and a pale red mouth. His hair is tied back with a purple bow with long tails. He wears a shirt with a ruffled neck and sleeves, a yellow waistcoat with purple buttons, a white jacked decorated with floral bouquets and sprigs, a yellow collar, and purple buttons, and matching breeches with red bands and a yellow flower on each knee. He has white stockings, and yellow shoes with a puce and white flower on each. The dog is white with brown patches. The scrolls and shell round the base are picked out in puce."]
