These publisher’s proofs show that Hardy grasped the opportunity to restore the original text and elaborate on it, after he had been obliged to sanitise it for the family readership of Harper’s Magazine. \n\nThe unbound proofs were heavily annotated by Hardy in 1895, and also contain the comments of the printer’s reader, George F. Stewart. When examined side by side Hardy’s autograph manuscript (MS 1-1911), they offer rare insights into Hardy’s creative process and ample material for the study of literary censorship and social history."]
