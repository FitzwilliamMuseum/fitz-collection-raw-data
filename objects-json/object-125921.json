In the distance on the right is Nasu no Yoichu. He rides into the waves and shoots down the fan that had been attached to a mast of the Taira ship as a challenge to his master, Minamoto no Yoshitsune; the fan belonged to the child Emperor Antoku whose father's spirit it was said to contain. To the left of this stands Taira no Tomomori (1152-97), a famous general of the Taira clan who committed suicide after the battle by jumping into the sea tied to an achor. In the centre, balanced on a toiwer of artifacts (including the anchor), is Antoku, who was also drowned when his grandmother jumped from the Taira ship while holding him in her arms. On the left is the invincible Earth Spider (tsuichigumo), a creature capable of spinning threads strong enough to entangle man or beast."]
