        "value": ["Etching on paper which has been trimmed (unevenly) around the image and laid down upon a larger sheet of laid paper. Half-length portrait of a young man directed towards the right with head turned towards the viewer. The sitter wears a powdered bob-wig and a black academic gown over a jacket and waistcoat and neckband above. Inscribed on the plate at lower right: 'P.S. Lamborn fecit Cantab:'. A handwritten inscription in black ink on the secondary support below the print: 'Rev.d Mr Barnewell [sic] / of Mileham in Norfolk. P.P. / __very scarce__'. The portrait was probably executed by Lamborn at some point during Barnwell's studies at Caius College, Cambridge between 1819-1823 or shortly after. A handwritten inscription on the verso: 'See Granger's Letters, p.88', references Rev. James Granger, _Letters between the Rev. James Granger ... and many of the most eminent literary men of his time: composing a copious history and illustration of his Biographical history of England [...]_, Longman, Hurst, Rees and Orme, London, 1805. The description of the Barnwell portrait in this volume references the fact that it was printed privately and not widely published, hence the inscription 'P.P' on the secondary support. See Notes. Lamborn's print was designed as a vignette, which is apparent from an untrimmed impression held at the British Museum. See: T,15.27."]
