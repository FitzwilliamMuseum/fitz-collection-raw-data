        "value": ["Burgonet, for infantry or light cavalry use. Formed of a one-piece skull with an integral peak, a pair of hinged cheek-pieces, and a neck-defence of one lame.  The skull rises to an acute point at its apex and is divided into four boxed panels by medial and transverse ridges that converge at the point.  The front edge of the skull is flanged forward to produce a prominent, slightly down-turned peak, the front edge of which curves forward to a fairly obtuse, central point, and has a file-roped inward turn accompanied by a recessed border.  The rear edge of the skull is flanged outwards at the nape to receive the neck-defence.    The lower edge of the flange is slightly cusped at its centre and outer ends where it is pierced with rivet-holes to attach the neck-defence.  A later hole pierced just to the inside of the left outer hole is plugged with a rivet.  The lower edge of the skull is cut away in a large arch at each side to accommodate the cheek-pieces.  The apex of each arch is cut with a shallow, rectangular notch to accommodate the hinge of the cheek-piece.  The front of the skull is fitted just above the peak with five externally-flush lining rivets, of which the central one lacks its flat, internal head.  The edge of the cut-out for the right cheek-piece is repaired, just above the notch for the hinge, with a riveted internal patch.  The edge of the cut-out for the left cheek-piece is cracked and pierced with a hole, possibly for a missing lining-rivet, at the same point.  The cheek-pieces overlap the skull and are attached to it by modern, plain, internal hinges with cropped corners, secured by pairs of modern, round-headed rivets.  The front and lower edges of each cheek-piece, which are respectively slightly concave, and flanged outwards as a continuation of the neck-defence, have file-roped inward turns accompanied by recessed borders.  The upper and rear edges of each cheek-piece curve in to a straight section at the hinge.  The centre of each cheek-piece is slightly embossed and pierced with four holes surrounding a further single hole.  The  lower front corner of each cheek-piece is fitted with a modern, internal leather loop secured by a modern round-headed rivet and circular, internal washer.  The upper front corner is cut with a rectangular notch to accommodate the outer edge of the peak.  The neck-defence of one lame is attached to the flanged rear edge of the skull by a modern round-headed rivet and circular internal washer at either end.  Its lower edge which curves down to an obtuse, central point, has a file-roped inward turn accompanied by a recessed border which is pierced with a pair of later holes."]
