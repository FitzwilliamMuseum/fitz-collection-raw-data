After considerable resistance it was reduced by Prince Maurice in sight of the enemy's army. He then undertook the siege of Nieuport, hoping to capture it before the Archduke Albert could bring to its relief his army, which was in a state of mutiny. He was disappointed in this, and compelled to a battle in the open field against a superior force. His order was arranged under the advice of Sir Francis Vere, who commanded 1,500 English troops, which were placed in the forefront of the battle, and which contributed mainly to the success. Having sustained a most arduous conflict, for a length of time with variable fortune, Prince Maurice was upon the point of retiring, when he perceived a wavering on the part of the enemy, and immediately charging with his cavalry drove them from their position in great confusion. He then brought forward his centre line, completed the defeat, and converted the battle into a disorderly flight. Of the 1,500 English, 800 were killed or wounded. Vere himself was severely wounded, and scarcely an officer remained unhurt. The Spaniards left 3,000 men dead upon the field, abandoned all their baggage, cannon and ammunition, and 130 standards, and lost a very great number of prisoners. This medal was struck in gold and silver for distribution among the officers of the States and of the Army according to their rank."]
