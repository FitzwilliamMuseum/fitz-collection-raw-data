        "value": ["Breastplate with associated skirt, for light field use. Formed of a main plate of  'peascod' fashion, with moveable gussets at the arm-openings and an associated skirt of two upward-overlapping lames.  The broad, concave neck-opening and the gussets at the arm-openings have file-roped inward turns.  That at the neck is bordered by a V-shaped rib showing traces of file-roping.  The turn of the right gusset is cracked at its lower end.  The main plate also shows a crack midway down its left arm-opening.  This has subsequently been repaired by brazing.  The arm-openings of the main plate are bordered by pairs of incised lines. The gussets at the arm-openings are secured to the main plate by modern, brass-capped, round-headed rivets with square, internal washers at their upper and lower ends.  The hole for the lower rivet of the left gusset has been moved slightly outwards.  Attached by a modern, brass-capped, round-headed rivet at each shoulder is a double-ended, tongued, iron buckle with simple incised decoration on its loops and a plain, rectangular hasp with cropped corners.  The rivet in each case passes through both the main plate and the gusset.  The lower edge of the main plate is flanged outwards to receive the skirt.  The skirt is formed of two upward-overlapping lames of chevron-shape.  The lower edge of the second lame is cut off straight over the crotch, where it is accompanied by a file-roped inward turn accompanied by a recessed border and raised rib.  The border is occupied by three brass-capped, round-headed lining-rivets.  The upper edge of each lame is bordered by a single incised line.  The skirt is attached to the flange of the breastplate by a modern round-headed rivet of brass, set a short distance in from each side.  The lames of the skirt are connected to one another by modern, brass-capped, round-headed rivets with a square internal washer at each side.  The upper edge of the second lame is fitted at either side with a pair of modern buff-leather straps for the suspension of tassets.  Each strap is secured by a pair of brass-capped, round-headed rivets with square, internal washers.  The lower left corner of the second lame is cracked. Part of the composite half armour HEN.M.13A-F-1933."]
