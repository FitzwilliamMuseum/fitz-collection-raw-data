Formed of a moderately long, tubular cuff, two downward-overlapping wrist-plates, five upward-overlapping metacarpal-plates, a shaped knuckle-plate, four scaled finger-defences and a hinged, scaled thumb defence.  The cuff is closed at the inside by an overlapped and riveted join.  Its damaged straight upper edge has a plain inward turn bordered by small stitching-holes.  The cuff, the wrist-plates and the metacarpal-plates are connected to one another at each side by sliding-rivets.  The finger-scales overlap upwards whereas the thumb-scales overlap downwards.  The second wrist-plate, which is repaired with a riveted internal patch at either end, is decorated with file-roped transverse rib.\nThe cuff is decorated at its upper edge with four incised lines, but is undecorated at its lower edge, suggesting that it may be associated with the remainder of the gauntlet which is decorated with triple incised lines.  The poorer condition of the cuff relative to the rest of the gauntlet tends to support this suggestion.  Some of the finger-scales are decorated with single incised lines, whereas most of the finger-scales and thumb-scales are undecorated suggesting that they are largely associated or restored.  Some are certainly restored."]
