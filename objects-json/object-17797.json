        "value": ["Tasset for the right thigh, for field use. Formed of nine, medially-ridged, upward-overlapping lames that widen to its lower end.  The inner edge of the tasset is cut away in a shallow, concave curve between the first and ninth lames which are slightly deeper than the rest.  The first lame has a short, transverse step at its inner end.  Its upper edge is cracked near its outer corner which is broken away.  The ninth lame has a straight lower edge with rounded corners.  The tasset has file-roped, inward turns at its upper and lower edges, and plain, partial inward turns at its inner and outer edges.  The turn at the lower edge is accompanied by a recessed border containing seven modern lining-rivets of which the outer ones are of externally-flush form, and the remainder of brass-capped, round-headed form with square, internal washers.  The upper edges of the second to ninth lames are decorated with pairs of incised lines.  The lames are connected to one another at their outer ends by modern brass-capped, round-headed rivets.  The rivets that connect the sixth and seventh lames, and the eighth and ninth lames to one another are fitted with square, internal washers.  The hole in the fifth lame for the rivet that connects the fifth and sixth lames to one another is reinforced by a vertical, oblong patch that is secured at its upper end by an externally-flush rivet.  The lames are further connected to one another at their inner ends and centres by modern internal leathers secured by single rivets.  The rivets are externally-flush, except for those in the ninth lame which are of brass with round heads and circular internal washers.  Located below these last, in what appears to be later holes, are modern brass-capped, round-headed rivets that at one time secured the lower ends of the leathers.  The central rivet is fitted with a square, internal washer that retains a fragment of its leather.  Modern brass-capped, round-headed rivets occupy construction-holes in the second to ninth lames, aligning with the rivet-holes for the attachment of the inner connecting leather.  The inner ends of the second, sixth and ninth lames, and the outer ends of the first, fourth and ninth lames are fitted with modern, externally-flush lining-rivets, in some cases retaining fragments of a leather lining-band.  A similar rivet was originally fitted at the outer end of the seventh lame.  The hole for it is now vacant.  The fourth and fifth lames have each been pierced at their centres with later holes that have subsequently been plugged with externally-flush rivets.  The first lame is fitted with three modern, double-ended, tongued, iron buckles with plain, rectangular hasps.  The hasps of the inner and outer buckles have cropped corners.  The inner, central and outer buckles are secured, respectively, by a flat-headed rivet, an externally-flush rivet and a round-headed rivet.  A pair of holes located to the inside of the inner buckle, and a single hole located to the outside of the outer buckle, must previously have served to secure those buckles, but are now plugged by externally-flush rivets.
