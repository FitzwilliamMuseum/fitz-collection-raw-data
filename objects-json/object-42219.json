The square base has scrolled edges and four scroll feet with a pierced rocaille motif between the front two. Winter sits on a heap of logs, pierced at the back by a roughly square aperture to take an attachment. He leans forward over a vase-shaped brazier. His left leg is crossed over his right, and his hands are held together over the brazier. He wears a puce hooded coat with a yellow lining, gold buttons, and dark blue cuffs with gold buttons. His breeches are white with a pattern of yellow, green, puce, and gold circular motifs, and he has white stockings, and black shoes with red and gold ties. The top of the base is incongruously decorated with three groups of three flowers and leaves. The edges and feet of the base are picked out in turquoise and gold, and the rocaille motif in puce and turquoise."]
