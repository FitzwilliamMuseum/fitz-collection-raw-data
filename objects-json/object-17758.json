The breastplate, of late 'peascod' form, is made in one piece, with file-roped inward turns at its neck and arm-openings, and a flange at the waist to receive the skirt.  A modern single-ended, tongued iron buckle is riveted at each shoulder just below the original holes for their attachment, which are now vacant.  The skirt, which is attached to the waist-flange of the breastplate by a rivet at either side, is formed of one lame.  Its lower edge is cut with a shallow arch over the crotch.  Attached by three modern straps and buckles at each side of the skirt is a tasset formed of five medially-ridge, upward overlapping lames.  The lower end of the tasset is strongly convex.  The second lame of the right tasset is cracked at its inner end, and the first lame of the left tasset lacks its upper inner corner.  The lames are connected to one another by rivets at their outer ends and by internal leathers at their centres and inner ends.  The connecting rivets of the right tasset move within slots.  The main edges of the skirt and tassets are decorated with file-roped inward turns.  Those of the tassets are accompanied by recessed borders and, in the case of their last lames, file-roped ribs.  The secondary edges of the skirt and tassets are decorated with file-roped partial inward turns.\nThe breastplate, skirt and tassets are all decorated with etched bands and borders of trophies on a stippled ground.  The main bands of the breastplate include cartouches containing classical figures, cherubs, sea horses and dolphins.  The main bands are in all cases bordered by narrower bands, in some cases decorated with guilloche. Part of the composite half armour HEN.M.8A-F-1933"]
