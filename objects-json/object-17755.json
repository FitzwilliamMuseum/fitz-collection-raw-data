        "value": ["Collar, for field use, with etched decoration. Formed of a single plate front and rear, each of which is flanged upwards at its neck-opening to receive at least one more lame.  The lower edge of the front plate is strongly convex, while that of the rear edge is only slightly convex with rounded outer corners.  The lower edges of both plates have partial inward turns decorated with etched roping and bordered by externally-flush lining-rivets or the holes for them.  Each plate is or was furnished with three rivets for the attachment of the internal leathers that would have secured the missing upper lames of the collar.  The rear plate shows a large rust perforation at its right side.  The front plate is repaired with a riveted internal patch at its right outer edge.  The front and rear plates are connected to one another at the left side by means of a rivet, and fastened to one another at the right side by means of a small, modern, mushroom-shaped stud and a keyhole-slot.  Riveted at each shoulder is a modern single-ended iron buckle for the suspension of the pauldrons.  The right buckle is furnished with a tongue.\nThe collar is etched at the front and rear with three diverging vertical bands of trophies involving a cartouche showing a warrior in 16th century costume, all on a blackened ground.  It is further etched at the top and bottom of each plate with narrow borders of dolphins, also on a blackened ground.  Both the vertical bands and borders are enclosed by narrower bands which are in some cases decorated with guilloche or roping.  The etched decoration is possibly modern.  That at the front appears to be extensively worn, but was possibly produced to give that appearance from the outset. Part of the composite half armour HEN.M.8A-F-1933"]
