A male figure (Ellenborough; Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough,1790-1871) with right hand pulling at uncombed hair and wearing a scowl with a copy of _The Times_ at his feet, stands between two other male figures, Wellington (Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, 1769-1852; Prime Minister from 1828 to 1830) to the left and Peel (Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet, 1788-1850; Prime Minister, 1834–1835 and 1841–1846) to the right, who each hold one of his arms. A speech bubble from Ellenborough's mouth: 'What shall I do?'. Speech bubble from Wellington: 'Control your grief my dear Friend- / you have been _indiscreet_, but you / shall not lose your Place - assume / a bold front as I am wont to do - / There is nothing like carrying things / with a high hand.'. Speech bubble from Peel: 'Be consoled, G- B- says he has / hit upon a nice little device which / he hopes will bring you off with the / C.....ns'. The artist's initials in monogram at lower centre (on newspaper): 'HB'. Title and publisher details printed below the border at lower centre: ' \"A WILD ELEPHANT _led_ BETWEEN TWO TAME ONES\". / Published by Thomas McLean 26 Haymarket, Feby 16th. 1830.'. Handwritten in graphite at upper right: '47'. See 16038,_Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires_, Vol. XI, 1828-1832, M.D. George, published 1954, pp. 264-5. A number '[47]' printed in square brackets in the right-hand margin on p. 264 relates to the handwritten number at upper right, both referencing the sequence of John Doyle's Political Sketches series."]
