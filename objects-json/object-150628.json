Metal clips would have been inserted and held the two sections of the pot together. This suggests that althought the bowl is decorated it was used in daily life. The vessel was wheelmade and covered on the outside with a slip (a mixture of water, pigment and clay). It is decorated with bands of black lines, with inverted triangle, fillled at the top with wavy lines. Pots similar to these have been found in temple areas and it is thought that they may have been dedicated there. It is also possible that priests living in the quarters around the temples also used such vessels. This fragment came into the museum probably through the Oxford Nubia Expedition, but because there were a number of fragments the objects were never formally registered. The clay is typical of that from southern Egypt/Nubia."]
