Formed in one piece with an almond-shaped crown that curves down at each side and rises to a short, backward-directed 'stalk' at its apex; and an integral brim that is turned down at each side and curves up to a point at the front and rear.  The edge of the brim has a file-roped inward turn accompanied by a narrow, recessed border.  The brim shows two cracks in its left edge and is pierced with three later holes at the centre of its left side.  The base of the crown is encircled by fourteen brass-capped, round-headed lining-rivets fitted with brass rosette washers externally, and circular iron washers internally.  Two of the external washers are incomplete, and two of the internal washers are missing.  Attached at the nape by a pair of brass-capped, round-headed rivets is a modern brass plume-holder with seven radiating arms with outward scrolled ends.  The centre of the plume-holder is engraved with a crowned coat of arms.\nThe helmet is decorated on its crown with twelve vertical bands of etched and gilt trophies that radiate from its apex.  Each  band is enclosed to either side by three narrow plain bands.  The base of the crown is encircled by five narrow, etched and gilt bands, of which the second and fourth are cabled and the remainder are plain.  The brim is decorated with etched and gilt scrolling foliage."]
