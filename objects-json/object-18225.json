It is composed entirely of riveted rings of flat section wire, having an outside diameter of approximately 1.0 cm.  A few rings are missing and others have been replaced with modern butted rings of circular section wire.  The sabaton has been cut from an earlier garment of mail: most probably a mail shirt or sleeve.  The sabaton is bright with a variable light to medium patination.\nThe left sabaton is of rectangular form with an obliquely-cut corner.  It is composed entirely of riveted rings of circular section wire, having an outside diameter of approximately 0.8 cm.  A few rings are missing.  The sabaton has been cut from an earlier garment of mail; most probably a mail shirt or sleeve.  The sabaton is bright with a light patination overall. Part of the composite Spanish armour M.13A-K-1941."]
