        "value": ["Lower end of pauldron, for the left shoulder, for field use, decorated with etched borders. Formed of three upward-overlapping lames curved to the outside of the upper arm.  The lames are connected to one another by sliding-rivets at the rear, and by internal leathers at the front and centre, secured to each lame by single externally-flush rivets.  All the rivets and leathers are modern.  The sliding-rivet that connects the first and second lames to one another has a large, round head and a circular, internal washer, while that which connects the second and third lames to one another has a smaller round head and no internal washer.  The rivet that attaches the central leather to the first lame has pulled out of the latter.  The outer leather is now attached to the first and third lames only, by rivets that occupy later holes pierced just to the inside of the original holes which have broken out to the upper edge on the second and third lames.  Modern, decorative, round-headed rivets occupy construction holes in the first and second lames aligning with the underlying original rivet-holes for attaching the front leather.  The fronts of the first and second lames are each pierced with a small, modern wiring-hole that must have served to connect the lames to one another when their connecting leathers broke.  A pair of later holes pierced at the upper edge of the first lame, between the sliding rivets and the central leather, must also have served to effect a makeshift connection between that lame and the now missing one above it.  The lower edge of the third lame is pierced with a rivet-hole beneath the sliding-rivets and beneath the front internal leather.  These holes served to connect the pauldron to the turner of the upper cannon of the vambrace.\nThe lower edge of each lame is decorated with an etched band of alternating, stylised acanthus scrolls on a plain ground between pairs of close-set lines."]
