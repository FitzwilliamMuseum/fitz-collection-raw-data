To the right, a slender man in wig and frock coat stands astride him, his left hand lifting up the man's chin and his right arm held aloft with a razor held open in his hand. Within an etched rectangular border. Etched onto the plate below the border at lower right: 'JKBaldrey Sculp.t'. A verse in latin etched on the plate below: 'Tonsor ego - Tonsoris opem si forte requiras, / Mappa subest - ardet Culter - et Unda tepet, / Des nummos - uno tibi Barba evanuit ictu, / Si male, tolle obolum: si bene - plura refer.' The publication date, place and printmaker etched below: 'Pub.d Feb.y 23.1785. by JKBaldrey, Cambridge'. The print is trimmed to the platemark and laid down on a larger sheet of paper, onto which is written in brown ink: 'Bob Foister vulgo the flying Barber / shaving Dick Robert's Fellow of Kings / they are equally good likenesses designed / by Rev.d J. Bearblock of King's Cambridge'. The design was later engraved with more background detail and published by W. Mason with the title: 'Bob Foster, The Cambridge Flying Barber'. See British Museum (BM), 1851,0308.276. See also BM, J,2.34, which is a companion to the earlier barbering scene after Bearblock (also etched by Baldrey and published on the same date) and features Foster hurrying along carrying his barber's equipment (ref. George, 6834)."]
