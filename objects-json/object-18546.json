        "value": ["Zischägge, for use by an harquebusier, with punched, engraved and gilt decoration. Formed of a one-piece skull, a peak, a sliding nasal-bar, a neck-defence of five lames, and a pair of cheek-pieces.  The hemispherical skull is decorated around its base with a raised band separated at an interval from a recessed band, and above them with radiating flutes of V-shaped section separated by raised ribs.  Riveted at the apex of the skull is a moulded finial that retains a large fretted brass washer bearing punched ornament.  The flat peak, which is attached at the brow of the skull by six round-headed rivets with square internal washers, projects forward to a truncated, acute, central point.  The peak is pierced at its centre with a rectangular hole to receive the sliding nasal-bar which is secured at the brow of the skull by a rectangular staple and locking-screw.  The upper end of the nasal-bar is of fretted, leaf-shaped form, and its lower end is fitted with a mushroom-shaped stud that serves as a stop.  The broad, flaring neck-defence is formed of five upward-overlapping lames with cusped upper edges.  The lower edge of the last lame, which is deeper than the rest, projects to a truncated acute central point.  The lames are connected to one another and to the skull at each side by round-headed rivets with square internal washers, and were formerly connected to one another medially by an internal leather.  The free edge of the neck-defence is bordered by lining-rivets.  The cheek-pieces are stepped at their upper edges where they fit under the skull.  Their sides curve in to a truncated point at their lower ends.  The centre of each cheek-piece is decorated with a recessed boss that is pierced with five circular ventilation-holes.  The cheek-pieces are attached to the skull by pairs of modern internal leathers that run down their sides as lining-bands and converge at their lower ends to form loops that served to lace them together beneath the chin.\nThe peak, the neck-defence and the cheek-pieces have plain inward turns or partial turns.  The helmet is decorated with recessed bands and borders of punched, engraved and gilt scrolling foliage."]
