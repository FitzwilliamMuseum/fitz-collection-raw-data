        "value": ["Lithograph (uncoloured) on white wove paper. Inlaid within a frame of buff wove paper (approx. height 360mm x width 515mm). The portly figure of John Bull, the gentleman farmer, stands at the centre, raising a staff in his right hand at a group of figures at the far left falling over themselves to get away, three of them with speech contained in speech bubbles: 'No Police'. Bull, with printed speech inside a bubble above: 'You miserable set of Ragamuffins, ... frightened the poor Lord Mayor, & His Majesty's Ministers / out of their wits!'. John Bull gestures with his left arm to a group of figures on the right; King William IV under whose cloak Wellington takes shelter and Peel (dressed as a policeman) who crouches behind him. The King, with printed speech inside a bubble above: 'I think the Don-Key as / they call him- has made us all / look very like asses!'. Wellington's response contained inside a speech bubble above: 'But your M-j-ty I had _other_ / Information ... I should be received in the City Hall / with \"cold indifference\"!!!'. Speech inside a bubble from an unidentifed figure behind Wellington: 'With cold indifference! / think of that!'. The artist's initials in monogram at lower left: 'HB'. Title printed below the border: 'THE FALSE ALARM: / or / Much ado about nothing.'. The publisher's details printed below: 'Published by Thos McLean, 26 Haymarket, Novr 16th 1830.'. Printer's details below the border at lower right: 'Printed by C. Motte, 23, Leicester Sqre.'. Handwritten in graphite at upper right: '89'. See 16326,_Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires_, Vol. XI, 1828-1832, M.D. George, published 1954, p. 366. A number '[89]' printed in square brackets in the right-hand margin on p. 366 relates to the handwritten number at upper right, both referencing the sequence of John Doyle's Political Sketches series."]
