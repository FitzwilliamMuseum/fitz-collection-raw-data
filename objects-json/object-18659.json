        "value": ["Half-shaffron, for field or tournament use, with incised and gilt decoration. Formed of a main plate and a pair of ear-defences.  The transversely curved  main plate is shaped to the brow.  It has a nearly straight upper edge and a semi-circular lower edge that extends a short distance below the level of the eyes.  The lower edge has a plain, inward turn.  The sides of the main plate have semi-circular cut-outs for the eyes.  The edges of the eye-openings are flanged outwards and decorated with plain, inward turns.  The upper corners of the main plate are cut away in concave curves to receive the low, rounded, gutter-shaped ear-defences.  The outer edges of the ear-defences have plain, inward turns except at their top ends which are cut off straight, perpendicular to the turned edge.  The ear-defences have flanged lower edges that fit within the main plate and are in each case attached to it by three modern, brass-capped, round-headed rivets.  The central rivet at the left ear and the lowest two rivets at the right ear now lack their brass caps.  The central rivet at the right ear is fitted with an octagonal internal washer.  The upper edge of the main plate is pierced at its centre with a pair of rivet-holes for the attachment of a missing poll-plate.  Located to either side of this pair of holes is a modern brass-capped, round-headed rivet with a square internal washer that retains a fragment of a leather strap.  Pairs of rivet-holes for the attachment of straps are pierced at the lateral edges of the main plate just above and below each of the eye-openings.  The upper of each of the pairs of holes below the eye-openings is occupied by a modern, brass-capped, round-headed rivet with a circular internal washer that retains a fragment of a leather strap.  The rivet below the right eye-opening lacks its brass cap.  The lower edge of the main plate is cracked and repaired with a riveted internal patch just to the left of centre.  Rust-perforations occur just to the right of this repair and at the left end of the lower edge.  The upper corner of the left ear-defence is broken off, and the upper corner of the right ear-defence is bent forward.\nAll external edges of the shaffron, except for that at the top of the main plate, are decorated with gilt borders.  The main plate is decorated medially with a narrow gilt band enclosed by a pair of incised lines.  The band is interrupted at the forehead by a circle enclosing a six-petalled flowerhead, also gilt and enclosed within incised outlines.  A hole at the centre of the flowerhead, now occupied by a modern, brass-capped, round-headed rivet, may at one time have served to attach a plume-holder.  A pair of holes pierced a short distance above the flowerhead probably served to lace up the plume."]
