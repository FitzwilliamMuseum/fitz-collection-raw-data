      {
        "value": ["Vambrace, for the left arm, for field use. Formed of a tubular turner, a tubular upper cannon, a winged couter of three lames, and a tubular lower cannon.  The turner is closed by an overlapped and riveted join at the inside of the arm where it is fitted with a modern leather loop.  At the outside it is articulated twice along concave lines.  The top section of the turner is missing, and the central section is broken through at its centre.  Its lower edge was originally fitted with two externally flush rivets that engaged and moved within horizontal slots cut in the upper edge of the upper cannon.  One of the rivets is now missing.  The upper cannon has an overlapped and riveted join at the rear.  It is pierced at the front with a later hole.  The couter is formed of three lames that overlap outwards from the second which is shaped to the point of the elbow and furnished with a centrally-puckered oval wing at the front.  The tapering lower cannon is formed of an inner and an outer plate: the former fitting within the latter.  The two plates are connected to one another at the rear by an internal hinge, and fastened at the front by a circular stud and hole.  The main edges of the vambrace have file-roped inward turns.  The vambrace is decorated with raised bright bands and borders against a blackened ground. Probably part of the same composite armour as HEN.M.138-1933, HEN.M.144-1933 and HEN.M.145-1933."]
