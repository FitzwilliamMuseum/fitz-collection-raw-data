Formed in two halves joined medially in an overlap that is brazed along the crest of the comb and secured by four externally-flush rivets at the front and rear of the brim.  It has a rounded crown that curves down at each side and rises to an exceptionally high medial comb; and an integral brim that is turned down at each side and curves up to a point at the front and rear.  The edge of the brim has a file-roped inward turn accompanied by a narrow, recessed border.  The base of the crown is encircled by eighteen modern, round-headed, brass lining-rivets with circular, internal washers retaining a modern buff-leather lining-band.  The comb has a large, welded patch on one side of one end.  The front and rear ends of the brim have each suffered slight damage.\nThe entire surface of the helmet is decorated with etched ornament.  The ornament on the comb and the crown consists of trophies and musical instruments separated by radiating darts, all on a stippled and blackened ground.  The two rows of darts on the crown are separated by a narrow, transverse band interrupted at intervals by alternating circles and ovals  enclosing four-petalled flowerheads.  The top of the comb and the top and bottom of the crown are bordered on each side by a narrow band of guilloche enclosed by a pair of narrow, plain bands.  The base of the crown is decorated on each side by a demi-flowerhead within a border, and the top of the crown by similar, but smaller, demi-flowerheads separated by the upper row of darts.  The ornament on the brim consists of stylised acanthus foliage and pellets on a hatched and blackened ground."]
