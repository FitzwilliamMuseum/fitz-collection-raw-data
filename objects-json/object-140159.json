The bowl has a globular body with a projecting rim and stands on three paw feet; on one side it has a loop handle. The circular, slightly domed cover has a button finial. The circular stand has curved sides and stands on a footring. The front of the bowl is decorated with a frame of scrollwork in gold with small areas of lustre and painting in iron-red and brown enamels, enclosing a Chinoiserie scene: a Chinese shop-keeper displaying his wares to a customer whose cloak is held by a little boy. On the ground is a ledger, inscribed 'Meis/1726 . . .'. Overhead there are flying insects and a dragon. On each side of the handle, and down its back, there are 'Indian' flowers, and on its sides, iron-red scrolls. The rim the claws on the paw feet, and the top and bottom of the handle are gilded. The cover has two Chinoiserie subjects forming a continuous scene: a seated woman playing with a baby; and a woman feeding a baby while four others play about her, and a man stgands holding  a basket full of monkeys. There are gold bands round the rim and finial, the top of which is also gold. The stand has a larger panel similarly framed, and painted with a Chinoiserie scene of a man seated at a table approached by a woman bird-seller and a pedlar; birds and insects fly overhead. The rim is encircled by elaborate gold scrollwork. On the back there are three iron-red concentric circles."]
