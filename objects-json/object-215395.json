A small chromolithographed paper butterfly is affixed to the 'frame' at upper centre. A central oval window contains a chromolithograph of a snowy scene of a cottage with trees to left and right. Mounted at lower centre is a paper ornament of an open book with chromolithographed centre and decorative gilt detail with printed verse: 'All the world I'll resign / If thou'lt only be mine'. Affixed below is a chromolithographed scrap of a partially-draped young boy carrying a corn sheaf over his left shoulder and a sickle in his right hand. Scraps of flower sprays are affixed at the four corners of the white lace-paper. The lace-paper front is adhered to the back paper. A hand-written inscription in graphite on the album leaf above: '1868', which is probably a transcription of a date found on the verso of the valentine prior to mounting into the album. The hand is recognisable as that of Miss Catherine Parsons and is seen in other albums throughout the collection, documenting and transcribing inscriptions, prices and maker's names. Catherine Parsons was a close friend of Glaisher towards the end of his life and undertook to arrange and mount his valentine collection into albums from the Autumn of 1924 through to the Summer of the following year and beyond."]
