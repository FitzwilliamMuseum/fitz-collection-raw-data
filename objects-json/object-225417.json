A head and shoulders self-portrait of painter, printmaker, writer and connossieur, Jonathan Richardson, the Elder, directed towards the left, head turned towards the viewer. He wears a shoulder-length powdered wig and a cravat at the neckline of his coat. This particular self-portrait was used as the frontispiece to the 1776 publication by James Dodsley of Richardsonâ€™s poems, which were written between 1732 and 1736 and published under the title _Morning Thoughts, or Poetical Meditations, Moral, Divine and Miscellaneous_. P.14808-R is a reduced state. P.14809-R is another impression of the same reduced state. See also the reduced state held at the British Museum: 1889,0409.350. The British Museum also holds impressions of earlier states; see Li,3.89 and Q,1.140."]
