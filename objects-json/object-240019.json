The prints which were loose inside this album were not original to it and had no connection to Lord Fitzwilliam or his print collection. See also P.14982-R, another Dominic Colnaghi acquired print which was once contained inside this album."]

R.A. 1817, no. 44; National Trust, Polesden Lacey, NT1246452, bought in 1918). The two boys beside a stream seen on the right, the younger boy kneeling on the bank to the left with his arms around the neck of a donkey and looking out at the spectator. The older boy stands behind, pulling on the reins around the animal's head and looking to the left. The portrait was given the title Rural Amusement when it was reproduced as a mezzotint by Bromley."]
