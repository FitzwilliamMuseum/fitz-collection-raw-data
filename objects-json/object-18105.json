Formed in two halves with a hemispherical crown joined by a turn along its low, medial comb, and furnished with a broad, slightly downturned, integral brim that is obtusely pointed front and rear.  Each side of the comb is decorated with two weakly raised ribs.  Each side of the crown is decorated at the top with four raised ribs of ogee form, midway down with four more ribs that rise to chevrons at their centres, and at the base with two more ribs accompanied by rows of decorative, round-headed rivets.  The ribs are emphasised by incised lines.  The pattern of ribs and rivets at the base of the crown are repeated around the edge of the brim, which has a plain inward turn.  Two of the rivets at each side of the base of the skull are fitted with square, internal washers for the attachment of missing cheek-pieces.  The outer row of rivets around the edge of the brim are fitted with square internal washers for the attachment of a missing lining.  Many of the rivets are replaced.  The arms of a probably modern brass plume-holder are retained by two of the rivets at the left of the nape.  The plume-tube is missing. Part of the composite pikeman's armour HEN.M.24A-B-1933."]
