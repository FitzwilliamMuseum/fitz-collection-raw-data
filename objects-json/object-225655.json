Wheatley was the first published African American female poet. She was probably born c. 1753 in Gambia or Senegal, sold into slavery, bought by the Wheatley family of Boston and taught to read and write. She was freed after the publication in 1773 of her book, \"Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral\". She married in 1778 and died in 1784.\n\nElizabeth Gower was the 4th child of Edmund & Hannah Gower, born on the 20th. October 1790 at Wramplinham, a village 4 miles north of Wymondham, Norfolk. She attended Ackworth School from 1800-1804, leaving on the 28th. May."]
