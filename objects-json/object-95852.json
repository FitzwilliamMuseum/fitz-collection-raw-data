The sides have panels veneered with rosewood and marqutry floral sprays. The commode is richly decorated with ormolu mounts, the top with a gadrooned border and the long drawer with three boldly cast and chased ram's heads linked by beribboned festoons of husks, with four foliate rosettes above, continuing round the sides. A reeded and banded ormolu moulding runs below the long drawer, and another at the base at the front and sides. The four lower drawers have reeded loop handles with foliate rosette backplates. Square ormolu foliate motifs at each corner of the four lower drawers, and at each corner of the side panels are linked by applied carved and gilt Greek key borders. It stands on tapering fluted and gadrooned ormolu legs. The name 'Daniel Langlois' is hand-written in red chalk on the carcase under the top drawer."]

The Marquis died in 1767, and a list of payments made to his creditors included one to 'Veuve Langlois' for two commodes, Pierre Langlois having died in February 1767. Tracey Langlois continued her husband's business until 1773. In 1774 Peter Langlois (Peter Daniel Langlois) her son,  was listed as ratepayer for the workshop, and continued until his death in 1781. Peter Daniel Langlois whose second name is written on the carcase of the commode below the top drawer, was 66 when he died in 1816 and was therefore born about 1749-50. He  was therefore old enough to be learning the cabinet-making trade at the time the commode was made. In 1771 he was apprenticed to the bronze-founder, Dominique Jean (c. 1736-1812), his brother-in-law, who took over the workshop in 1781."]
