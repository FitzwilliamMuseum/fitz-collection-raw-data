        "value": ["Reinforce for the left pauldron, for use in the tourney field, with bands of etched decoration. Formed in one piece with a high, upstanding haute-piece.  The lower half of the reinforce is shaped to the shoulder, the armpit and the top of the chest.  The outside of the shoulder and the centre of the haute-piece are each strongly boxed along a vertical ridge.  The upper edge of the haute-piece is nearly horizontal, with strongly rounded outer ends.  It has a file-roped inward turn accompanied by a recessed border that continues around the convex edge of the portion of the reinforce that extends over the chest.  The reinforce is pierced just below the centre of its haute-piece with a circular hole to accommodate the stud that would have secured it to the front of the pauldron.  It is further pierced at the lower end of its outer edge with a vertical, rectangular slot that would probably have fitted over a rectangular turning-pin or stud that connected the pauldron to the vambrace.\nThe reinforce is decorated in a medial band, and in a short diagonal band that runs downwards and outwards from the centre of the haute-piece, with etched trophies, birds, dolphins, fantastic animals, herms and horned masks on a stippled and blackened ground. The same design occurs in the borders that run all the way around the edge of the reinforce, except where it overlaps the top of the arm.  The base of the haute-piece is decorated with a narrow band of etched guilloche on a blackened ground.  All the bands and borders that decorate the piece are themselves enclosed by groups of either two or three plain, narrow bands.  The lines between the narrow bands show traces of gilding at some points."]
