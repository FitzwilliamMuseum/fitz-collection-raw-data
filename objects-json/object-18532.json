The rounded skull is made in two halves joined medially by a riveted overlap that is decorated with a file-roped rib. The top of its face-opening and the lower edge of its integral neck-defence have file-roped inward turns accompanied by recessed borders. Each side of the face-opening is pierced with pairs of holes for the attachment of missing cheek-pieces. The pivoted peak is of light weight and associated.  It has been reworked to match the skull. Its obtusely pointed front edge has a plain inward turn accompanied by a recessed border. The separate buffe is formed of a single medially-ridged plate with an integral neck-defence. It is shaped to the chin, extends upwards to the centre of the brow, and projects as a lateral cusp over each cheek. It is cut with a large rectangular vision-slit and a large rectangular ventilation-slot over the mouth.  Both the vision-slit and the ventilation-slot have file-roped edges bordered by a single incised line. The edge of the integral neck-defence has a file-roped inward turn accompanied by a recessed border. Each side of the buffe is pierced with two holes that served to attach it in some way to the helmet."]
