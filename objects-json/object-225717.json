The tradition was continued at Sidcot, founded as a Quaker School in 1808, but samplers inscribed ‘Sidcot’ are very much rarer than those from Ackworth.\nThe Fitzwilliam has several Quaker samplers, early ones for the City of London, later ones from Ackworth, but no examples of white darning samplers. Once removed from its backing and cleaned Ann Young’s sampler would be an interesting addition to our increasing holding of Quaker examples."]
