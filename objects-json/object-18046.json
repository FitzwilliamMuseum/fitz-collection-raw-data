        "value": ["Two tassets and poleyns, nearly forming a pair. The tassets are each formed of eleven medially-ridged, upward-overlapping lames that widen from the first to the fifth lame and then narrow again from the sixth to the eleventh lame.   The first lame, which is wider and more heavily-constructed than the rest, is associated.  It is transversely boxed and decorated with a file-roped rib along the angle of the boxing.  It is pierced above the angle at each side with later horizontal slots that must at some time have fitted over rectangular studs riveted at each side of the waist-flange of the breastplate.  A raised rectangular panel located mid-way between the slots, and pierced at its centre with a large circular hole, is designed to fit over the protruding bolt of a suspension-hinge riveted at each side of the lower edge of the breastplate.  The tassets are divisible between their sixth and seventh lames which are connected to one another at each side by turning-pins and keyhole-slots.  The lames are otherwise connected to one another by modern siding-rivets at their outer ends, and by modern internal leathers at their inner ends and centres.  Each tasset terminates in a poleyn formed of four medially-ridged lames that overlap outwards from the second which is shaped to the point of the knee and furnished at its outside with a moderately large triangular wing.  The front edges of each wing appear to have been cut.  The second lame is decorated medially by a file-roped rib enclosed between a pair of narrow grooves.  The second lame of the right poleyn is decorated at its outside with a file-roped transverse rib.  The main edges of the tassets and poleyns are decorated with file-roped inward turns accompanied by recessed borders.  The turns of the left tasset and poleyn are file-roped in both directions, producing a series of X's.  The secondary edges of the tassets and poleyns are decorated with pairs of incised lines. Part of the composite armour HEN.M.20A-H-1933."]
