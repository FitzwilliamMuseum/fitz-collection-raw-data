The shallow oval tray (C.177.1) has lobed ends and wavy sides with an indentation in the middle and stands on a footring. The rounded cup (C.177.2) has a scrolled handle.  The saucer (C.177.2A) has shallow curved sides and stands on a footring. The sugar bowl (C.177.3) has almost straight sides which curve inwards to the footring and a slightly domed cover (C.177.3A) with a knob in the form of a multi-petalled flower on a stalk with two leaves. There are suspension holes in the footrings of the tray and saucer.\n\nThe tray is decorated with rose border with blue and gold striations, and narrow gold and blue lines on the outer and inner edges, the latter scalloped. The white flat area is decorated with four floral sprays of different sizes. There is a gold band round the rim, dentilated on the exterior. The cup has a similar ground and one truncated heart-shaped reserve, containing an arrangement of flowers. There is a dentilated band round the rim, a plain band round the footring, and gold lines on the edges of the handle. The saucer has a similar border and a bouquet of flowers in the centre. The sugar bowl has two truncated heart-shaped reserves with a scalloped gold line round the edge containing floral sprays, and the cover has two kidney-shaped reserves similarly edged and painted with a smaller floral sray. There are gold bands round the rim, footring, and edge of the cover, and the knob, stalk, and leaves are gilded."]
