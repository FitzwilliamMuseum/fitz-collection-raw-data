        "value": ["Tasset for left thigh, for field use. Formed of ten medially-ridged, upward-overlapping lames that widen to its lower end. The inner edge of the tasset is cut away in a shallow concave curve that becomes most pronounced immediately below the first lame. The tenth lame, which is considerably deeper than the rest, has a slightly convex lower edge with strongly rounded corners. The lower and lateral edges of the tasset have strongly file-roped inward turns accompanied by recessed borders. The border at the lower edge is enclosed above by a file-roped raised rib. The border of the tenth lame is occupied by seven brass-capped, round-headed lining-rivets with circular internal washers. The second rivet from the inner end lacks its head, while the central rivet and the innermost rivets each lack their internal washers. The borders of the lateral edges are occupied by a further ten lining-rivets of externally-flush form. The rivets occupy the inner and outer ends of the first, third, fifth, seventh and ninth lames. The upper edges of all ten lames of the tasset are decorated with single incised lines, while those of the second to tenth lames are also decorated medially with V-shaped nicks. The lames are connected to one another at their inner and outer ends by modern, brass-capped, round-headed rivets. That which connects the eighth and ninth lames at their inner ends is fitted with an octagonal internal washer. A pair of horizontally-aligned, brass-capped, round-headed rivets located in the tenth lame, immediately below the inner column of rivets, suggest that the lames were originally connected to one another at their inner ends by internal leathers. It is probable that the rivets that now connect the inner lames to one another occupy the holes for the leathering-rivets and the overlying construction-holes that were originally occupied by purely decorative, round-headed rivets. The lames were further connected to one another at their centre by an internal leather secured by single externally-flush rivets, except at the tenth lame where it was secured by a pair of brass-capped, round-headed rivets with octagonal internal washers. Only the inner of the pair of rivets is now employed to retain the present, modern leather, which has severed between the ninth and tenth lames. The unused outer rivet lacks its washer. The first lame is fitted with three modern, double-ended, tongued, iron suspension-buckles. The buckles have rounded rectangular loops and rectangular hasps with cropped corners and notched sides. They are each retained by single round-headed brass rivets. A pair of holes pierced just above the outside of the outer buckle probably represent earlier suspension-points. Part of the composite armour HEN.M.14A-L-1933."]
