      {
        "value": ["Collar for field use, decorated with fluting in the 'Maximilian' fashion. Formed of four upward overlapping lames front and rear.  The top lame in each instance has a prominent, plain, angular, inward turn at its upper edge.  The bottom lame in each instance is considerably deeper than the rest and has a slightly convex lower edge with rounded corners.  The lames are connected to one another by three modern internal leathers front and rear.  The outer leathers are connected to each lame by pairs of rivets, and the central leathers by single rivets except on the lowest rear lame where the central leather is attached by a  pair of rivets.  The rivets are externally-flush throughout, except on the lowest lame in each instance where they are round-headed with octagonal, internal washers  Decorative round-headed  rivets occupy construction-holes in the second to fourth lames, aligning with the outer of the underlying pairs of rivet-holes for the outer connecting-leathers. Later holes at the centre of the second to fourth rear lames aligning with the underlying rivet-holes for the central connecting-leather have been plugged with externally-flush rivets  These holes must at one time have served to rigidly secure the lames to one another.  The lowest rear lame is pierced at the centre of its lower edge with a pair of lace-holes.  The front and rear sections of the collar are connected to one another at the left side by a hinge with short rounded ends secured within the top lames by a single externally-flush rivet front and rear.  The front and rear sections are fastened to one another at the right side by a pair of vertically-aligned, plain, circular studs on the top rear lame engaging a pair of circular holes in the corresponding front lame.  The lower stud is now missing.  The front and rear sections of the collar are further fastened to one another at the right side by a mushroom-shaped stud riveted at the bottom of the front edge of the lowest rear lame engaging a keyhole-slot in the rear edge of the corresponding front lame. The front and rear sections of the collar are now rigidly secured to one another at the left side of the lowest lames by a round-headed rivet with an octagonal, internal washer.  They would originally have been fastened there by a stud or turning-pin and a keyhole-slot.  Attached by a single, round-headed rivet with an octagonal internal washer to either side of the lowest rear lame, on the top of the shoulder, is a modern hinged stud with a sprung lug, to engage a hole in the top of the shoulder-defence.  The hinges have rounded ends.  Beneath each hinge is a vacant hole which may have served to attach an earlier hinged stud.  A later hole pierced just to the rear of each hinge, beneath the lowest of the outer pair of leathering-rivets, is plugged with an externally-flush rivet.  A single later hole at the lower right corner, and a pair of later holes at the lower left corner of the lowest front lame have been plugged with externally-flush rivets.  The lower left corner of the lowest front lame is broken away.  The upper edge of the lowest front lame is cracked at either end.  The lower edge of the lowest rear lame is cracked a little to the right of centre. The front and rear of the collar are each decorated, except on the first lame, with fifteen flutes, emphasised by pairs of incised lines and diverging slightly downwards and outwards. Part of a composite armour, M.1.1A-H-1936"]
