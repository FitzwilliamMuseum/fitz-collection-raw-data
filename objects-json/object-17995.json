The tassets are each formed of thirteen upward-overlapping lames that narrow towards their lower ends where they are fitted with poleyns of five lames that overlap outwards from the third, which is shaped to the point of the knee and expands to a small, pointed wing at its outer end.  The lames of the tassets are connected to one another by modern sliding-rivets at their outer ends and by modern internal leathers at their inner ends and centres.  The lames of the poleyns are connected to one another by modern round-headed rivets at their inner and outer ends.  The first lame is pierced at the centre of its upper edge with a later-enlarged, horizontal keyhole-slot that serves to suspend it from the mushroom-shaped stud of the waist-flange of the breastplate.  The two tassets are connected to one another medially by modern straps riveted at the inner ends of their first lames.  The strap of the left tasset terminates in a double-ended, tongued iron buckle.  the lowest lame of each poleyn which projects downwards to a central point, is  at each side with later keyhole-slots, presumably for the attachment of greaves.  Riveted within each end of the third lame of the poleyn is a modern leather strap, the outer of which terminates in a single-ended, tongued iron buckle.  The main edges of the tassets and poleyns have plain inward turns bordered by pairs of incised lines.  The secondary edges of the tassets and poleyns are bordered by pairs of incised lines within single incised lines.  The first lame of each tasset is decorated with a file-roped transverse rib.  Slight differences in the details of the two tassets suggest that they are not an exact pair but probably derive from the same series of armours. Part of the composite three-quarter armour HEN.M.17A-G-1933."]
