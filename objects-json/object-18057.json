        "value": ["Pauldron, for the right shoulder, for field use, composed of elements of a similar period and fashion. Formed of eight medially-ridged lames that overlap outwards from the third which is shaped to the point of the shoulder.  The first to third lames extend inwards over the chest in a strongly concave curve.  The first to third lames also extend inwards over the back.  The third lame is expanded downwards to the level of the bottom of the fourth lame at the rear.  The expanded portion has a strongly rounded lower corner and is flanged at its outer edge where it overlaps the lames beneath it.  The lames are connected to one another by modern brass-capped, round-headed sliding-rivets with internal washers at their rear ends, and by modern internal leathers at their front ends and centres. A further leather at one time connected the first to fourth lames to one another a short distance behind the central leather, but is now only preserved between the second and third lames.  The first lame is pierced with a large hole at its apex to permit its suspension from a hinged stud issuing from the side of the collar.  A modern strap and a modern double-ended, tongued iron buckle to fasten the pauldron around the upper arm are respectively riveted within the rear and front ends of the eighth lame.  The main edges of the pauldron have file-roped inward turns, except at the fronts of the second to eighth lames and the rears of the fourth to eighth lames where they have plain partial inward turns. Part of the composite armour HEN.M.20A-H-1933."]
