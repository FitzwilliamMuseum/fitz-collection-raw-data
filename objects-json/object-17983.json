Each formed of twelve lames that overlap outwards from the fifth which is slightly shaped to the point of the shoulder.  The first to fifth lames expand inwards over the chest and the back.  The fifth lame is expanded downwards to the level of the bottom of the seventh lame at the front, and the eighth lame at the rear.  The expanded portions are flanged at their outer ends where they overlap the lames beneath them which only extend to the inside of the arm.  The lower edge of the twelfth lame, which is longer than the rest, is cut away in a curve at the front to clear the inside of the elbow.  The first to fifth lames are connected to one another by round-headed rivets at their rear ends, and by internal leathers at their front ends and centres.  The fifth to twelfth lames are connected to one another by three internal leathers.  Attached by a single rivet at the apex of the first lame is a modern external, double-ended, tongued, iron buckle, and modern internal strap that served to suspend the pauldron from the collar.  A single-ended, tongued, iron buckle riveted within the front edge of the twelfth lame, and a strap riveted within the rear edge of the same lame, served to secure the pauldron around the arm.  Riveted within the main edges of each pauldron are the remains of leather lining-bands and crimson velvet piccadils.  The main edges of the pauldron have file-roped inward turns.  The subsidiary edges are filed with V-shaped nicks and low rounded cusps.  The front and rear of the fifth lame, and the rear of the twelfth lame of each pauldron are decorated with groups of eleven round-headed rivets in rosette formation. Part of the composite half armour HEN.M.16A-F-1933."]
