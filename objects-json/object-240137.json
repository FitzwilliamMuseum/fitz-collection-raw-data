The identity of the sitter is uncertain, although she is generally thought to have been a courtesan, the portrait by Reynolds having been commissioned by Sir Charles Bunbury, one of her admirers. Chaloner Smith asserts the name 'Polly Kennedy' only in parentheses and Goodwin hesitantly indicates Polly Kennedy adding, '(or Jones)'. Mannings cites from Reynolds's Pocket Book, in which he refers to her merely as 'Miss Kennedy' and speculates that, 'she may have been Polly Kennedy (? lived in Great Russell Street; died 1781), 'of an Irish family', as Tom Taylor suggested'. Seated, three-quarter-length to the front, head in three-quarter profile towards the right, left leg towards the right also. Her right arm raised, holding a cloth in her hand, her left arm extended along her left knee. She wears a pale gown with a repeat pattern of flower sprigs with an oriental scarf tied around her waist and a lavish, brocade coat, trimmed with ermine. Jewellery of long, pearl and stone necklace, large pearl, dropper earrings and a tiara-style headdress."]
