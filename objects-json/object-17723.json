Formed of a main plate, a pair of side-plates, and a waist-plate with integral skirt. The main plate is shaped to the shoulder.  Its vertical lateral edges bisect the arm-openings. They overlap the side-plates which are in each instance attached to them by modern round-headed rivets with octagonal internal washers. The broad, shallow neck-opening of the main plate is cusped at its centre.  Attached within the lower edge of the main plate and the side-plates by five round-headed rivets with octagonal internal washers, is a separate waist-plate which is flanged outward to form a short skirt.  The lower edge of the skirt is cusped at its centre and at each side.  The arm-openings, the neck-openings and the lower edge of the skirt have file-roped inward turns.  Attached at each shoulder by a single round-headed rivet with an octagonal internal washer is a modern leather shoulder-strap.  Attached by similar rivets and washers midway along each side-plate is a modern leather strap forming a waist-belt.  The broken left strap terminates in a modern double-ended iron buckle, lacking its tongue.  The main plate and side-plates are decorated with recessed, bright bands and borders against a blackened ground in the 'black and white' fashion.  The border at the neck is of ogee form, and the lateral vertical bands are medially-ridged.  The waist-plate and its skirt are decorated with raised, bright bands and recessed bright borders against a blackened ground. Part of the composite half armour HEN.M.3A-E-1933"]
