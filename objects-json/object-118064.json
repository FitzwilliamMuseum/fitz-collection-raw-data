Sticks of pierced horn (false tortoiseshell), decorated with applied gold foil; guards of horn backed with gold foil (12+2).  Rivet of brass, washer of tortoiseshell.  Front:  The large central panel shows the crowning of 'La Rosiere' with a young woman bending over to receive a wreath of roses from a man in 18th century dress.  Behind him, on the right, a standing man, a sitting woman, an empty chair with a man and a woman standing behind under a vine, and a group of women and children under trees and a young man behind an older man leaning against a tree; in the background, there are houses and watching children.  The two flanking panels are both in blue and gold with cartouches in the centre, the borders of which are decorated in the same way; both cartouches have woman lying in the grass, painted in a negative style in blue and grey on a copper background.  The borders of both panel and cartouche are decorated with scrolling ornaments; the space in between is filled with scrolls.  The leaf is bordered by a ribbon, of panels, top and left edging are of gold foil.  Back:  The copper and gold bordered cartouches have a dark blue background with heavy gold scrolls, all showing visitations of angels.  In the centre, a girl reading and an older woman sitting in front of two columns and a table on the right; the angel is hovering to the left of them with a house in the background.  On the left, a standing angel is showing a book to two women who are kneeling in front of him; on the right, a couple are sitting under a tree, a praying angle behind them and a house in the background on the left.  All figures are in late Medieval/ early Renaissance dress. Sticks:  two sticks at a time form oval medallions with a flower flanked by two sprays of leaves.  At the bottom of each stick there are scrolling leaves; on top there are wreaths with leaves enclosing a gold flower.  On the reverse there are pairs of leaves in the medallions.  Guards:  both guards are decorated with sprays of leaves and flowers."]
