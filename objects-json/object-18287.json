Formed in one piece with a rounded crown that curves down at each side and rises to a high, roped, medial comb;  and an integral brim that is turned down at each side and curves up to a point at the front and rear.  The edge of the brim has a file-roped inward turn accompanied by a narrow, recessed border.  The comb is decorated with single incised lines at its crest and base.  The base of the skull is encircled by fourteen round-headed rivets fitted with brass rosette washers externally, and square iron washers internally.  The rivets retain a linen lining-band.  Two of the rivets at each side retain fragments of the leathers for the attachment of the missing cheek-pieces.  A pair of rivet-holes pierced at the nape, just above the level of the lining-rivets, served to attach a missing plume-holder.  One of the holes is occupied by the stump of a rivet.\nThe helmet has suffered denting at the crest of its comb, and has lost the tip of its point at the front end of the brim."]
