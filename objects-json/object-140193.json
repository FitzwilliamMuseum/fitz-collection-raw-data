The rounded square low mound base has a tree stump support in the back left corner, and is decorated on top with applied leaves, a red and white flower, and a blue flower with yellow centre. The porter steps forward onto his right foot and has his left behind him. He looks towards his right, holding out his right hand in front, and grasping the top of a walking stick in his left hand. He has red lips, and curling black hair which is shoulder length at the back, and is partially covered by a black tricorne hat with two short gold straps and a button on its left side. He wears a white shirt, a mauve coat with gold buttons, yellow breeches, white stockings and black shoes with gold buckles. Slung on his back by means of two buff straps over his shoulders, is a brown wooden rack containing a rectangular black parcel with white cords, and an oval buff-coloured box."]
