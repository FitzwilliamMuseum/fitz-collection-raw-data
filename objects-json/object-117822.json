Sticks and guards of shaped and pierced ivory (16+2), engraved, overlaid with gold foil and inlaid with cut-steel sequins; the guards are also set with painted mother-of-pearl covered by glass/crystal discs.  Rivet set with red pastes.  Front:  painted overall with a lake or river landscape.  In the middle putti propel a barge bearing two couples in wedding costume.  Above there is a temple containing an altar of love and gaily-attired putti and goddesses frolicking joyfully in the clouds.  In the water in front of the barge there are four putti swimming, one sailing a little boat, one riding a swan and two couples riding dolphins.  On the right and the left there are wide gilt borders of formal flowers, foliage, scrolls and Greek key, and across the top a narrow border of scrolls and formal foliage.  Reverse:  A central vignette of a card party printed in black and painted colours, flanked by stylized floral sprays painted in gold and black.  The right and left sides have wide borders of formal foliage and scrolls painted in gold with touches of black, and roses in two shades of pink and white.  Across the top there is a narrower border of foliate scrolls, an ellipses and triangles with a rose spray at the centre.  Sticks:  elaborately shaped and pierced to produce rows of circular holes flanked by foliage.  At the shoulder each stick has a circular un-pierced area decorated with trefoil leaf in gold foil surrounded by cut steel sequins.  Guards:  the lower part is set with cut steel sequins.  At the shoulder there is a circular inset of mother-of-pearl painted with a pansy framed in gold and covered with a disc of glass/crystal.  The upper part is pierced with a formal design, partly gold foiled and backed with gold foil.  On the back of the guard on the left when the fan is showing the front, there is the number '2629' in black ink."]
