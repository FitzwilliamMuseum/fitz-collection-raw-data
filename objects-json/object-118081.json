Sticks of ivory with quatrecouleur gold foil; guards of ivory with quatrecouleur gold and backed with mother-of-pearl and puce foil (14+2).  Rivet set with clear pastes.  Front:  There is a fan leaf-shaped frame of gold sequins, divided into sections.  The central panel, which is bordered by green sequins, shows a woman in contemporary dress sitting on the ground with a tray of flowers in front of Cupid on a cloud, who is binding two hearts together; beside; two kissing doves; in the background a woman is holding a garland of flowers and a man is leaning on a wall.  In the scene on the left, a man is asking a woman for a dance, another man is sitting next to them.  In the scene on the right, a couple is walking beside a high wall and another couple is sitting under a tree.  The outer scenes are bordered with mauve sequins.  Between the scenes there are blue medallions with monograms surrounded by sprays of flowers.  The outer panels have a large spray of flowers and are hanging from the top with a swag.  The upper and lower edges of the leaf are bordered by swags of flowers, and the right and left ends by sprays of flowers.  A herringbone pattern serves as a background for the leaf, which is bordered by a pale blue and gold striped line.  The top edging is of a white paper ribbon with gold dots and a gold border.  The bottom left and right borders are painted in gold.  Back:  the back is painted in the same sections with a vase of flowers, scrolls and garlands of flowers in the middle and sprigs of flowers in the medallions and the outer panels.  The outer border looks like fern; the inner frames are of chains of circles.  Gold and brown scrolls border the leaf.  Sticks:  At the centre, there is a music trophy medallion on a background of striations comprising drums, a lute and a trumpet.  The next three sticks on either side have trophies, one with a balloon on top.  The first two sticks on either side have two dogs on a mat above a pedestal surrounded by scrolls.  Guards:  Both guards are decorated in a similar way.  On the shoulder there is a panel with a basket decorated with flowers, and on he guard proper there is a trophy in an oval medallion, a vase, two doves and a balloon on top."]
