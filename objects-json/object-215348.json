        "value": ["PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION: A 4to-size half-bound book in red leather and blue cloth boards with 'SCRAP BOOK' and double fillets tooled in gold along the spine. The leaves of cream wove paper are brittle and acidic. '56' is written in graphite on the verso of the fly leaf at the upper left corner. One card has been cut from the album (between nos. 24 and 25) and the remains of paste on a number of leaves indicate that others have been removed from the album at some point. The scrap album is almost certainly one of those mentioned by Glaisher in letters to Miss Catherine Parsons held in the Fitzwilliam Museum archive as originating with the London bookseller, John Salkeld. Salkeld is first named as a source of valentines from February 4th, 1925 onwards, especially in relation to albums containing valentines. See MS 919-1985. In another letter to Miss Parsons dated May 20th, 1925, Glaisher tells her that: 'The scrap book came yesterday from Salkeld and I have sent it to you today. As I understand it, it comes from the same lady from whom the other scrap album (not the last) came, who is in want of money, and Salkeld is not buying it himself, but is selling it for her. ...'. See MS 950-1985. The album contains similar markings in graphite of a single initial above some of the valentines, which is also seen in album P.14420-R, another suspected Salkeld purchase, acquired by Salkeld from the same source. CONTENTS: The album contains valentines generally dating from the 1850s and 1860s and mainly decorative valentines employing collage and cameo-embossed lace-paper. Among these is a rare Joseph Mansell card containing a Baxter-process print. See P.14418-R-7."]
