Its meaning is not certain. It has been identified as the mark of a repairer and modeller named Tebo or Thiebaud, who between 1774-5 for Wedgwood, but for whom no evidence has been found for working at Bow. The other suggestion is that the marks stand for a member of the Toulouse family, of whom a Charles Toulouse was mentioned in the Bow Paris Register in October 1750. See p. 29 and p. 43.\nCf.
