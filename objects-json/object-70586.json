The main body of the helmet is made in one piece and working marks are visible on the interior surface. \n\nA band of copper alloy with a raised hollow cylinder (for holding feathers?) is attached over the top of the helmet with two rivets. \n\nOn the sides of the helmet are additional metal components that may have been used to hang textile elements over the ears.  These are made from copper alloy and are attached with two larger rivets and a line of small rivets.  On the proper right (PR) side the metal on the inside has a line of punched holes that correspond to the rivets on the outside.  This is not present on the proper left (PL) ear piece, suggesting that the PR one was wrongly attached and later turned round.  On the PL side, the metal work has been repaired, probably in antiquity.  A strip of copper alloy has been attached to the inside and outside of the helmet with what appear to be lead solder on visual examination.\n\nOn the front of the helmet and PL back area areas of mineralised textile or other organic material."]
