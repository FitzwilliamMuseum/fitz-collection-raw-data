The glaze extends over part of the open underside and up into the figure. The base is approxim-ately square with a swirly surface, and has a broad tree stump at the back. The sports-man sits on the stump, resting his left elbow on the top of the branch, and supporting his gun with that hand. His left leg is bent and his right leg is extended so that the foot projects a little way over the front edge of the base. His right hand is across his body and his hand rests on his left thigh. He has a queue, and wears a tricorn hat with a button on the front, a shirt, a jacket with buttons down the front and on the lower part of the sleeves, turned up breeches, gaiters, and shoes. He has a small bag slung on a strap across his body. A small dog sits beside his right leg."]
