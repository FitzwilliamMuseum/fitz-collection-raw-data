The turner and upper cannon are each closed by overlapped and riveted joins at their rears.  Riveted at the outside of the turner is a flat turning pin with a semi-circular head to engage a slot in the pauldron. The couter is formed of three lames that overlap outwards from the third which is shaped to the point of the elbow and expands to a narrow wing at both the front and the rear.  The lames are connected to one another and to the upper and lower cannons by rivets at their outer ends.  The lower cannon is formed of an inner and an outer plate: the former fitting within the latter.  The plates are connected to one another at the rear by a pair of external hinges, and were formerly fastened at the front by a circular stud and hole. The stud is now missing.  The lower edge of the outer plate of the lower cannon and the wing of the couter have file-roped inward turns.  The upper and lower edges of the inner plate of the lower cannon and the upper edge of the turner have plain inward turns. The vambrace is decorated on the wings of the couter and in a medial band with etched interlacing foliage involving trophies and oval cartouches enclosing human figures, all on stippled and blackened ground.  It is further decorated in subsidiary bands with etched stylised acanthus foliage, also on a stippled and blackened ground.  The main and subsidiary bands are enclosed by groups of narrower bands that are in some cases decorated with guilloche or roping.  These narrower bands are repeated at some of the main and secondary edges of the vambrace. Part of the composite half armour HEN.M.8A-F-1933"]
