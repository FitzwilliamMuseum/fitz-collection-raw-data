The underside is glazed an has four supporting struts projecting inwards from the sides, and a large round ventilation hole under the urn.                   The rectangular straight-sided base is decorated on three sides with panels containing swags of flowers and foliage in relief, held up at either end by a gold stud. The edges of the panels are bordered by gold lines and the top is grey-green. Artemisia stands beside an urn on a pedestal, resting her left elbow on its top and holding a cup in her right hand which also rests upon it. Her weight is on her right leg, her left foot is crossed over in front of it, and she leans forward and looks down.  She has greyish-brown hair, brown eyes and eyebrows, and red lips, and on each cheek, a tear. She wears a gold frontlet and a salmon-pink, white and gold veil which hangs down at the back and is held  in her left hand beside her shoulder. The lower part of her body is wrapped in a white, gold-edged garment, over which she has a tunic with a green and purple sprigged and dotted pattern, and mauve edges and lining, which reveals most of the right side of her body. On her right upper arm she has a gold and mauve bangle, and on her feet gold sandals. The square pedestal has mouldings on the upper and lower edges and is painted in salmon pink, pale yellow and gold. The urn is white with a series of green oval indentations on its neck, and gold lines on the edges of the relief decoration. On the front it has a rectangular panel inscribed in gold with the Greek words ΘΕОІΣ/ ΚΑΤΑΧΘΟΝΙΟΙΣ’. A brown-edged yellow shawl is draped over its back."]
