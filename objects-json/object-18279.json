Formed in one piece with a rounded crown that curves down at each side and rises to an exceptionally high, roped, medial comb; and an integral brim that is turned down at each side and curves up to a point at the front and rear.  The edge of the brim has a file-roped, inward turn accompanied by a narrow, recessed border.  The base of the crown is encircled by thirteen round-headed lining-rivets of brass-capped iron, except in the case of the front three which are later replacements and of solid brass.  All of the rivets, except for the three replacements and that at the centre rear are fitted with octagonal or circular internal washers.  Six of the lining-rivets are fitted with external, brass, rosette washers.  The central lining-rivet and the lining-rivet immediately behind it at each side also served originally to attach a missing cheek-piece.  A pair of rivet-holes pierced at the nape, just above the level of the lining-rivets, served to attach a missing plume-holder.\nThe entire surface of the helmet is decorated with etched ornament on a stippled and blackened ground.  The ornament on each side of the comb consists of interlacing strapwork involving trophies and birds surrounding a central quatrefoil cartouche enclosing the bust of a classical warrior and further trophies and birds.  The ornament on each side of the crown consists of seven bands of trophies separated by groups of five narrow bands of which the central one in each case is decorated with pairs of diagonal lines, and the others remain plain.  The ornament on the brim consists of stylised acanthus foliage."]
