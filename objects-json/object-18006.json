It is medially-ridged and dips strongly to the centre of the waist.  Riveted at each side of the chest is a modern mushroom-shaped stud that serves to engage the shoulder-straps of the backplate.  Large modern wiring-holes have been pierced at each arm-opening and to either side of the centre of the neck-opening.  Those at the arm-openings have subsequently been partly closed.  Attached by a single round-headed rivet at each side of the breastplate, just above the  waist-flange, is a modern, hinged iron hasp for the suspension of the tassets.  The distal end of the left hasp is fitted with a mushroom-shaped stud, while that of the right hasp is fitted with a symmetrical turning-pin.  The arm-openings and the neck-opening have plain inward turns.  The turns of the former are bordered by single incised lines.  Three pairs of incised lines diverge upwards and outwards from the waist to the centres of the arm-openings and the neck-opening respectively.  The centre of the left side of the breastplate is struck with the proof-mark of a bullet.  The breastplate appears originally to have been made for use by an harquebusier rather than a cuirassier. Part of the composite three-quarter armour HEN.M.18A-F-1933."]
