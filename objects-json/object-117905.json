Front:  in the centre, a couple are sitting on a rock in front of trees and bushes; a woman holding a flower is standing next to them on the left, behind her a herm and a building with three high arches.  There is another woman sitting on the left on the ground and a hunting scene with a stag followed by two riders in the background on the right.  Blue and pink flowers and leaves border the scene.  Back:  there is a ruin with three arches surrounded by bushes, two shadow-like, very small figures and some bushes and grass in the foreground.  top right and left borders are decorated with scrolling pink and blue leaves and flowers.  Sticks:  there are seven gold bordered medallions, the middle of which has a woman sitting under a roof and a man standing in front of her; it is flanked by two medallions of flowers, the left one with a basket of flowers on top, like the central one.  The first three sticks on either side have two medallions one above the other.  On the left, there is a hen at the bottom and a rabbit with a long tail on top, and on the right, there is a bird with open wings above the rabbit.  Empty spaces are filled with sprays of flowers.  The reverse is undecorated.  Guards:  both guards are decorated in a similar way:  a scrolling spray of leaves on the shoulder, scrolls and garlands of flowers on the bottom of the guard proper, a woman sitting under a roof and two little arches on top."]
