The roughly circular mound base is decorated in relief at the front with scrolls flanking a rocaille ‘frill’, and rises up at the back into a tree stump with a branch bearing clusters of small flowers and foliage projecting on each side. On the top there are three groups of flowers and leaves. The woman stands in front of the tree with her feet together, her head turned to her left. In her right hand she holds a triangle at waist level, and in her left, held lower down, she holds the remains of a baton to strike it with. She has black hair dressed up at the back, ruddy cheeks, red lips, and black eyes. She has a red band over the top of her head, and wears a white chemise with three-quarter length sleeves and ruffles under a turquoise bodice with a gold patterned stomacher, and a pink skirt which is bunched up at the front to show a white petticoat with a pattern of small red, dark pink, and blue flowers and gold foliage. Her shoes are pink with an orange-red flower on top of each. The flowers on the base, and on the bocage, are white with differently coloured centres: blue and yellow, red and yellow, and dark pink and yellow. The front of the base is picked out in green, turquoise, and gold. A pair with C.27A-1918"]
