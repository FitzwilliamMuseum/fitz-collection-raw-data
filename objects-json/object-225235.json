        "value": ["Lithograph (uncoloured) on white wove paper. Inlaid within a frame of buff wove paper (approx. height 360mm x width 515mm). Scene in an interior featuring John Scott, 1st Baron Eldon (1751-1838), Lord Chancellor from 1801 to 1806 and again from 1807 to 1827, the Duke of Wellington (1769-1852), who was Prime Minister from 1828 to 1830 and John Singleton Copley, Lord Lyndhurst (1772-1863), Eldon's successor as Lord Chancellor. The Duke of Wellington stands at the centre, printed speech to the left: 'Come my old friend - don't take your / defeat so much to heart - you fought well! / & altho' you did throw a large paving Stone / at me, I -'. Eldon sits in a chair to the left, his left elbow resting on some books on a table, printed speech to his right: 'Poh! I threw no paving stone / at you - but you all like to have / a dash at the Old Chancellor!'. Lyndhurst in gown and wig enters from the right with printed speech to the right: 'There he is - just like / an old white Lion'. The artist's initials in monogram at lower left: 'HB'. Printed below the border at lower left: 'Printed by C. Motte, 23. Leicester Sq.'. Title and publisher's details printed below the border at the centre: 'THE OLD WHITE LION / Published by Thos. McLean, 26. Haymarket'. Handwritten in graphite at upper right: '3'. See 15831,_Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires_, Vol. XI, 1828-1832, M.D. George, published 1954, p. 176. George states that the publication date of '7 July 1829' is known from a handwritten inscription in pen and ink. A number '[3]' printed in square brackets in the right-hand margin on p. 176 relates to the handwritten number at upper right, both referencing the sequence of John Doyle's Political Sketches series."]
