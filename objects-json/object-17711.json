Formed  as a collar of three upward-overlapping lames front and rear, and integral s of six upward-overlapping lames each.  The upper edge of the collar has a plain, inward turn.  The lower edge of the collar is straight at the rear, and obtusely-pointed at the front.  The lames are connected to one another by three internal leathers front and rear.  The front and rear sections of the collar are connected to one another at the left side by an internal hinge, and fastened at the right side by a mushroom-shaped stud and keyhole-slot.  The lowest lame of each spaudler has a plain inward turn at its lower edge where it is cut away in a concave curve over the front of the armpit.  It is fitted there with a single-ended, tongued iron buckle to receive the strap that was formerly riveted within the rear of the lame.  The lames of the spaudlers are connected to one another and to the collar by modern, round-headed sliding-rivets with octagonal internal washers at their rear ends, and by modern internal leathers at their centres and front ends.  The upper end of the right front leather is fitted with a mushroom-shaped stud that engages a keyhole-slot in the lowest front lame of the collar. Part of the composite half-armour HEN.M.2A-E-1933"]
