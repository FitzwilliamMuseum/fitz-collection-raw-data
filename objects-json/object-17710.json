        "value": ["Burgonet for light cavalry use. Formed of a skull with an integral peak, a pair of hinged cheek-pieces and a neck-defence of one lame.  The rounded skull is formed in two halves joined by a turn to the left along its high medial comb.  It has been repaired at several points with riveted internal patches.  The peak projects forward to a fairly acute point.  Its front edge has been trimmed, removing a turn of which remnants survive at each side.  The lower edge of the neck-defence, which is obtusely-pointed, has a plain inward turn.  The cheek-pieces, which are attached by internal hinges, are of fairly square form, with rounded upper rear corners.  Their upper front corners are notched to fit over the rear ends of the peak.  Their lower edges, which have plain inward turns, are flanged outwards to form a continuation of the neck-defence.  Each cheek-piece is embossed at its centre with a flowerhead formed of six slender petals, and pierced with five small, circular ventilation-holes in rosette-formation.  Riveted in the lowest hole of the left cheek piece is a later circular stud of uncertain function.  A tapering, tubular plume-holder with integral arms is riveted at the nape of the skull. Part of the composite half-armour HEN.M.2A-E-1933"]
