Two men (identified as tax collectors) seated at a cloth-covered table, the figure on the right looking out towards the spectator and pointing to a ledger which his companion is filling in with a quill pen whilst examining a coin held in his other hand. The table is littered with coins, money bags and jewels. Writing paraphenalia is seen on the table to the left. A parrot sits on a perch behind the men to the left and a shelf above holds other ledgers and documents and an unlit candle."]
