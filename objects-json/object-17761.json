        "value": ["Pair of cuisses and poleyns, for medium field use, with later etched decoration. Each formed of a cuisse of one plate and a winged poleyn of four lames.  The medially-ridged, gutter-shaped cuisse has a convex upper edge which is decorated with a file-roped inward turn, bordered by a file-roped rib.  Riveted within the upper corner of each cuisse is a modern buff leather strap, the outer of which terminates in a single-ended tongued iron buckle.  The outer lateral edge of the cuisse is decorated with a file-roped partial inward turn.  The lower edge of the cuisse is overlapped by a poleyn of four medially-ridged lames that overlap outwards from the second which is shaped to the point of the knee and has a small, oval side wing with a medial pucker at its rear.  The wing of the second lame and the convex lower edge of the fourth lame are each decorated with file-roped inward turns accompanied by narrow grooves.  The secondary edges of the poleyn are decorated with file-roped partial inward turns.  Each poleyn shows a rust-perforation at the point of the knee.  The centre of the lower edge of the fourth lame of each poleyn is pierced with a later horizontal slot intended to engage the turning-pin of a greave.  It is almost certain, however, that these cuisses and poleyns would originally have been worn without greaves.\nThe cuisses and poleyns are each decorated medially with an etched band of trophies on a blackened and stippled ground, repeated at the upper border of the cuisse.  The medial band is bordered to either side by three narrow bands of which the central one is decorated with guilloche.  These narrow bands are repeated around the wings of the poleyn.  The etching is modern. Part of the composite half armour HEN.M.8A-F-1933"]
