        "value": ["Pair of tassets, for field use. Each formed of nine medially-ridged, upward-overlapping lames that widen to its lower end.  The inner edge of each tasset is cut away in a shallow, concave curve between the first and ninth lames which are slightly deeper than the rest.  The inner ends of the second to eighth, and the outer ends of the first to eighth lames, have plain, partial inward turns.  The lower edge of the ninth lame is straight with rounded corners.  It has a file-roped inward turn accompanied by a recessed border and a raised rib.  The border is occupied by seven modern, round-headed brass or brass-capped lining-rivets.  The third rivet in from the outer end of the left tasset is fitted with a small, circular internal washer.  The lames are connected to one another at their inner and outer ends by modern round-headed rivets of brass with circular internal washers, and at their centres by modern internal leathers secured by single rivets which are externally-flush, except for that in the ninth lame in each case, which is of brass with a round head and a circular internal washer.  Nine of the rivets that connect the inner and the outer ends of the right tasset to one another lack their internal washers, as does one of the rivets that connect the inner ends of the left tasset to one another.  The rivets that connect the inner ends of the lames to one another probably replace internal leathers.  They occupy what were originally leathering-holes and the overlying construction-holes that were originally filled with independent round-headed rivets.  The inner ends of the third and fourth lames of the right tasset have been rigidly secured to one another by a modern externally-flush rivet occupying later holes.  The inner ends of the second, sixth and ninth lames, and the outer ends of the first, fourth, seventh and ninth lames of the right tasset are fitted with modern brass or brass-capped lining-rivets, as are the inner ends of the fourth, seventh and ninth lames, and the outer ends of the first, third, sixth and ninth lames of the left tasset.  The first lame of each tasset is fitted with a pair of modern, double-ended, tongued iron buckles with oval loops and plain rounded hasps.  Each is retained by a single round-headed rivet of brass with a circular internal washer.  The first lame of each tasset was originally fitted with three buckles.  The present buckles are located between the holes for the attachment of the original buckles, except for the present inner buckle of the left tasset which is located at the same point as the original inner buckle.  The remaining holes for the attachment of the original buckles are filled with modern round-headed rivets of brass with circular internal washers.  The outer rivet of each tasset lacks its washer.  Vacant holes are located just below the inner and outer rivets, and just above the central rivet of the right tassets.  It is conceivable that the hole above the  present central rivet is actually the original hole for it. Part of the composite half armour HEN.M.13A-F-1933."]
