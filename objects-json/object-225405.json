A half-length image of an unclothed woman with bared breasts and adorned with jewels; a heavy, metal necklace inset with gems and pearl droppers and two strands of pearls and jewels in her curled hair which is tied up at the back and swept high off her forehead. Her head is turned slightly towards the left. Title etched below: 'Jane Shore from an Original Picture in the Provost's / Lodge at King's College Cambridge.'. Inscribed in graphite (Eric Chamberlain's hand?) at upper right: 'Jane Shore'. The print was made in the late 18th century by local Cambridge antiquary, Michael Tyson, after the oil on panel portrait at King's College, which was and is still attributed as a likeness of Jane Shore (c.1445-c.1527; mistress of Edward IV), but which is now generally thought to represent Diane de Poitiers (1499-1566; mistress of Henry II of France).
