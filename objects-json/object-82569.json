Sometimes the gloves end at the wrist / (and in all cases with archers) then a gauntlet / of scalework is added. / To the elbow of the hauberk sometimes plates of metal / were fixed called coudi√®res, but rarely in this centy. / The hauberk was made with or without a collar. / In the first half of the centy the continuous coif is / nearly flat at the top, in the second half rounded. / The coif is drawn over the head by means of an / opening in the side and then fastened by a lace, / a buckle or a tie - the coif is sometimes / encircled by a fillet / The Hood of chain mail appears designed as an improvement / on the continuous coif by rendering unnecessary the side / opening and lacing about the face, but had the great / disadvantage that as it lay on the shoulders of the / knight it let the lance of the enemy pass beneath / it."]
