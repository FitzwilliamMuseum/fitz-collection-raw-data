For this plaque it is possible to differentiate between top and base due to the indicated and separated base similar to the one scarabs normally have (0,001m high). The hieroglyphs are carved very carefully and in much detail. The plaque has a vertical suspension hole indicating the function as an amulet. Due to the convex top this plaque is very close to the meaning of scarabs (for the example of a rectangular scarab see E.117.1920)."]
