The shallow domed cover has a ventilation hole and a cone-shaped knob.  The body is decorated with swirling stripes, alternately with an underglaze blueground in which are reserved scrolls partly painted in paler blue, and with a white ground, painted in green, red and puce with floral sprays.  Similar sprays are painted on the underside and top of the handle. On the back of the handle there are two puce wavy sprays of foliage. Round the top there is a red scalloped line and dots. On the  base there is a blue circle. The cover has a white knob, surrounded by radiating swirling stripes to match those on the pot, and round its edge has a border of red scallops and dots within a narrow red line."]
