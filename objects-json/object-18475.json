        "value": ["Burgonet, of 'Todenkopf' form, of great weight, for seige use. Formed of a skull with an integral neck-defence and a pair of applied reinforcing-plates, and a pair of hinged cheek-pieces that fasten together at the front, each with an integral neck-defence and a pair of applied reinforcing-plates.  The rounded skull is made in two halves that are joined medially by a riveted overlap that is decorated with a file-roped rib.  Riveted to each side of  the skull is a heavy reinforcing-plate.  The right one bears the proof-mark of a musket-ball.  A rivet projecting from the side of each reinforce may originally have served to attach a peak.  The lower edge of the skull is flanged outwards to form a rounded neck-defence which retains fragments of a linen lining-band.  The cheek-pieces are attached to the side of the skull by robust hinges that are riveted to the skull externally and the cheek-pieces internally.  The rear and upper edges of the cheek-pieces are cut to produce a face-opening that takes the form of a broad curved chevron at the level of the eyes, that narrows over the nose and widens to a small transverse lozenge at the level of the mouth.  The lower edge of each cheek-piece is flanged outwards to form a continuation of the neck-defence of the skull.  The cheek-pieces are fastened to one another at the front by a pierced stud and swivel hook riveted to their respective neck-defences.  The cheek-pieces retain much of their linen lining-bands.  Each is fitted between the level of the eyes and the neck with an applied reinforce secured by rivets.  The neck-defences of the skull and the cheek-pieces have file-roped inward turns accompanied by a single incised line.  The turns of the neck-defence are damaged at some points.  The face-openings of the cheek-pieces have file-roped, bevelled edges accompanied by single incised lines."]
