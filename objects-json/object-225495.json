        "value": ["Etching on paper. A vignette of two full-length figures, a middle-aged man and a woman who each carry large basketfuls of crockery. The woman, on the left, is seen in profile facing right. She wears a bergere-style straw bonnet over a cloth cap or kerchief tied at the nape and a shawl around her shoulders. Her bodice is patterned with vertical stripes. Her sleeves are rolled up to the elbow and she carries a basket filled with crockery on her right arm. The gentleman, seen in three-quarter profile to the right, wears a wig under a tricorn hat, waistcoat and long coat. He carries a large basket full of crockery on his right arm. The inscription etched onto the plate at lower right displays errors in transfer: 'T. Orbe f.t 1[7; etched back-to- front]68'. A handwritten inscription (hand unknown) in graphite in the lower margin: 'D. Randal, and Mother Hammond Fruitsellers at Cambridge'. P.14884-R was included in the exhibition of portraits and caricatures from the Cambridge Antiquarian Society's collection and the Fitzwilliam Museum, held at the Fitzwilliam in 1908 and listed in the catalogue in the section 'Cambridge Caricatures' as no. 7, [Randal & Hammond] (no. 1)'. However, this identification and the graphite inscription in the lower margin would appear to be erroneous. This print does not apparently relate to an earlier inscription found on the verso of the print, as is the case with P.14883-R, and the physical resemblance to the pair seen in P.14883-R (and re. Hammond to P.14879-R) does not tally. The fact that they are carrying baskets of pots and not fruit or herbs may relate them to an unidentified print by Orde of College pot washers or figures associated with the Cambridge Pot Fair.
