Ecclesiastical bands around his neck and an open book held in his right hand. An inscription in pen and ink over graphite above: 'Rev.d Mr Masters'. The drawing is laid down on a larger sheet of paper which is inscribed in graphite at lower right: 'Historian of Cambridge / Drawn by S. Ireland / From [?]hester?p Colln'. This portrait presumably relates to Robert Masters (1713â€“1798), an English clergyman and academic, who was known as the historian of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. His major work was _The History of the College of Corpus Christi and the Blessed Virgin Mary (commonly called Bene't) in the University of Cambridge, from its foundation to the present time_. The first part was published in 1753 and the second in 1755, which contained accounts of the lives of members of the college and an appendix of documents. An expanded edition by Dr. John Lamb was published in 1831. Only the engraved portrait of Masters by George Facius after Thomas Kerrich is described in O'Donoghue."]
