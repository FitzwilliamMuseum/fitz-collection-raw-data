      {
        "value": ["Burgonet, for light field use. Formed of a one-piece skull with an integral peak and neck-defence, and a pair of associated, hinged cheek-pieces.  The skull rises to a moderately high medial comb and a pair of slightly lower, lateral combs, each of which extends from just above the brow to just above the nape, and is decorated at its crest with deeply embossed notches.  The fairly short, flat peak projects forward to an obtuse central point.  The short neck-defence deepens slightly to its centre.  The lower edge of the neck-defence, which is cracked midway along its left side, is bordered by seven modern lining-rivets, retaining substantial fragments of a leather lining-band.  The rivets are round-headed with circular internal washers, except for the outer ones which are externally-flush to permit the overlap of the cheek-pieces.  Seven modern round-headed lining-rivets with circular internal washers run around the brow of the skull.  The left three have small heads, matching those of the neck-defence.  Four further modern rivets with small round heads are arranged in a square formation at the centre of the brow, just above the lining-rivets.  Their uneven spacing suggests that the holes for them represent a later modification, perhaps for the attachment of some form of applied ornament.  Five round-headed lining-rivets with circular internal washers originally run around the nape of the skull.  The outer ones have been removed, and the holes for them opened out to keyhole-slots, perhaps to attach a buffe.  The remaining three rivets retain fragments of a leather lining-band.  Four modern rivets with small round heads are arranged in a square formation at the centre of the nape, just above the lining-rivets.  Once again, their uneven spacing suggests that the holes for them represent a later modification, perhaps for the attachment of some form of applied ornament.  The lower edge of the skull is cut away in an arch at each side to accommodate the cheek-pieces.  The apex of each arch is cut with a shallow rectangular notch to accommodate the hinge of the cheek-piece.  The upper edge of the notch is flanged outwards.  The edge of each arch is bordered by four lining-rivets, all of which are externally-flush to permit the overlap of the cheek-pieces.  The cheek-pieces are attached to the skull by plain, rectangular hinges with cropped corners, secured at each end by pairs of modern round-headed rivets.   Each cheek-piece is more or less rectangular in outline.  The upper rear corner is cut off diagonally at the hinge.  Its upper front corner is rounded and shaped to fit over the rear end of the peak.  The shaped portion is file-roped.  The lower edge of each cheek-piece is flanged outwards to form a continuation of the neck-defence.  A total of eleven modern round-headed lining-rivets run around each cheek-piece.  The lower front rivets are fitted with circular internal washers that retain modern buff-leather loops to receive a modern leather thong that ties the two cheek-pieces together.  The upper end of each cheek-piece is pierced with a circle of eight circular ventilation-holes surrounding a similar single hole.  The main edges of the peak, the cheek-pieces and the neck-defence have file-roped inward turns. Part of the composite half armour HEN.M.4A-D-1933"]
