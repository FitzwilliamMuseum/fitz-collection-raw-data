Sticks pierced and cut ivory with silver and gold encrustations.  Guards carved ivory with silver encrustations backed with foil (12+2).  Rivet and washer of brass; probably replaced in the 19th century.  Front:  probably a marriage fan with a couple in contemporary dress in the centre standing in a garden in front of a pedestal.  Two differently decorated columns flank them on a ground, which is also decorated with sequins.  Above the couple, a star of paint and purple sequins, slightly scrolling chains of sequins and a little Chinese-style pavilion of silver thread; beside the right column, a vase of flowers worked in silver thread.  On the left, flanked by two decorated columns a chinoiserie with two very small figures on a tree-stepped round pedestal.  Above a hovering Chinese roof and on the left a little building; on the right a chinoiserie with a man sitting on the ground flying a kite and another one standing in a pavilion.  Painted plants decorated with gold thread and sequins.  A double line wrapped with leaves runs round the left top and right sides and there is a single gold-red line at the bottom.  Back:  Undecorated.  Sticks:  From the guards to the middle the sticks are decorated symmetrically.  The first three sticks form and oval medallion with a pierced star in the middle, the other sticks have semicircles on a base; the fourth stick has a chain of rhombuses between two lines and the fifth stick has a zigzag line between two straight lines.  The two sticks in the centre show a floral sprig, a mandolin and a flute on a background of pierced striations, and a bow and floral spray.  The reverse is undecorated.  Guards:  both guards are decorated in a similar way:  a single profiled line on the shoulder.  The guard proper is divided into fields:  four circles on the bottom, two sprays of flowers, a mandolin, an open book, and a stick with a ribbon on a background of pierced striations, inlaid with foil and decorated with dots in the corners; on top, semicircles above a clover leaf flanked by pipes dangling from bows."]
