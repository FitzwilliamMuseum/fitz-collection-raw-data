The modifications found in 'The Briar Wood' are a decrease in the amount of the left knee and fingers of the left hand which are visible. In the 1870 version the head and neck of the figure are thrust back to a greater degree, the position of the left hand is changed as are the legs from that of the study.  Verso: this study is a modification of those found on ff. 11 recto and verso and 12 recto. It is not used in the final paintings of the 1870 or 1884 versions of 'Briar Rose'."]
