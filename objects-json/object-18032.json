Each formed of a tasset of fifteen upward-overlapping lames that  narrow to its lower end where it is fitted with a poleyn of five lames that overlap outwards from the third which is slightly shaped to the point of the knee and expands at the outside to a moderately large, obtusely-pointed wing.  The first and fifteenth lames are longer than the rest.  The first lame has an inward-angled upper edge.  It is pierced at its upper edge with a large hole that served to suspend it from a hasp riveted to the lower edge of its breastplate.  The hole is pierced in a small raised panel designed to fit over the hasp.  The fifteenth lame is decorated at its centre with four round-headed rivets in lozenge-formation.  The lames of the tasset are connected to one another by modern round-headed sliding-rivets at their outer ends, and by modern internal leathers at their inner ends and centres.  The lames of the poleyn are riveted to one another at their outer ends by modern round-headed rivets with square internal washers.  Riveted within the inner and outer ends of the third lame of the poleyn are modern straps that fasten around the rear of the knee by means of a modern, double-ended, tongued iron buckle that terminates the outer one.  The fifth lame of the poleyn, which originally descended to a cusped lower edge, has been cut short and pierced at either side with a keyhole-slot intended to engage a stud and a turning-pin riveted at either side of the upper edge of a greave with which it was associated in modern times.\nThe main edges of the tassets and poleyns have plain inward turns bordered by pairs of incised lines.  Pairs of incised lines also border the secondary edges of the tassets and poleyns which rise to low central cusps at their centres. Part of the composite three-quarter armour HEN.M.19A-G-1933."]
