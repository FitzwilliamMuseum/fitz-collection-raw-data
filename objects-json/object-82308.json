In the middle, an oval view of Piccadilly Circus on Boat Race Night covers the base. The area is full of people, some swarming up the stairs of a bus, others on the roof of a car and atop a building. Signs advertise Guinness; Bovril; Schweppes; Bass; Dunlop and The Palladium theatre; a clock shows 11.30. The sky is dark; yellow light shines from the buildings; pale blue highlights the thronging crowd. There are four further oval vignettes on the outside of the bowl. One shows the race in progress: the light blue boat pulling ahead of the dark blue, boats on the riverbank, cheering spectators highlighted in pink. Two show spectators in a flag-bedecked boat beside a bridge, and in a steamship, with swans and reeds on the bank. The fourth is a smaller graphic emblem of a mermaid in a boat, under the yellow-rayed sun in a blue sky, surrounded by four sets of oars. The colours are used sparingly to highlight features of the images."]
