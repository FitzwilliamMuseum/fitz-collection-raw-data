A pair of men, swaggering drunkenly in the foreground, the taller and younger of the two is Lord Stanhope (Philip Henry Stanhope, 5th Earl Stanhope, 1805-1875) links arms with the older, miserable-looking man, Lord Eldon (John Scott, 1st Baron Eldon, 1751-1838), who has his hands in his pockets. A third figure, Wellington (Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, 1769-1852; Prime Minister from 1828 to 1830), dressed as one of the New Police, stands in the background to the left. Printed speech above him contained inside a speech bubble: 'I say my worthies can't you go on / quietly & not make such a confounded / noise - why you will frighten all the old / women out of their wits.-'. Printed speech in a speech bubble above Lord Stanhope: 'That's a pretty thing to say to people in / our desperate condition! _Go on quietly_ & / _don't make a noise!_'. Printed speech inside a speech bubble above Lord Eldon: 'I can tell you my fine fellew! [sic] / that you must submit to hear _more noise_ unless something be / done for the people _ I know the / _law_ as well as you or any man / in England - and D-me! I'll / make as much noise as I like.'. The artist's initials in monogram at lower right: 'HB'. Title printed below the border: 'APair [sic] of VERY RIOTOUS FELLOWS alias RADICALS of the NEW SCHOOL. / \"Ye Little Stars (Such as Hunt & Cobbett) hide your diminished heads\" '. The publisher's details printed above the title, below the border: 'London Pubd by McLEAN'. Handwritten in graphite at upper right: '56'. See 16075 and 16075A. 'A close copy (or the original)', the spelling of 'fellew' corrected to 'fellow' and published by Edward McLean, March 1830,_Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires_, Vol. XI, 1828-1832, M.D. George, published 1954, pp. 278-9. A number '[56]' printed in square brackets in the right-hand margin on p. 278 relates to the handwritten number at upper right, both referencing the sequence of John Doyle's Political Sketches series."]
