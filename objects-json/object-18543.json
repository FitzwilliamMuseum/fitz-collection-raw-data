        "value": ["Szyszak, for use by an hussar. Formed of a skull fitted at its front with a separate peak, a sliding nasal-bar fitted at its lower end with a broad face-defence, a long, laminated neck-defence and laminated cheek-pieces.  The one-piece, hemispherical skull is decorated with radiating shallow flutes between a broad, recessed border at its lower edge, and a large, recessed circular panel at its apex.  The centre of the circular panel is occupied by a large, transversely-pierced rectangular staple, riveted through a brass roundel decorated with concentric raised rings.  Attached by six brass-capped, round-headed rivets at the brow of the skull is a moderately broad, slightly-downturned peak that projects forward to an acute central point.  The rear of the peak is pierced at its centre with a later or later-enlarged rectangular slot that accommodates the sliding nasal-bar.  The nasal bar is secured by a rectangular staple that is attached at the brow of the peak by the central pair of rivets that secure the latter to the skull, and is fitted at its front with a winged locking-screw.  The nasal-bar is decorated with three lines of punched dots.  Attached by three brass-capped, round-headed rivets to the front of its expanded lower end is a broad, transversely-curved face-defence that flares forwards and outwards at its lower edge.  The upper edge of the face-defence has two semi-circular cut-outs for the eyes.  The cut-outs have flanged and decoratively-filed edges.  Each side of the face-defence is decorated with a raised roundel.  The roundels, the space between them and the lower edge of the face-defence are fretted with hearts, crosses, circular holes and bone-shaped holes.  Attached by a pair of brass-capped rivets at the nape of the skull is a later, tapering, tubular plume-holder, decorated with filed lines, small circular holes, and V-shaped nicks at its upper and lower edges.  Attached by five brass-capped, round-headed rivets at the nape of the skull is a long neck-defence formed of ten medially-ridged, downward-overlapping lames that extend down the back to an acute ogival point.  The tenth lame, which is longer than the rest, has an acutely-pointed, ogival lower edge.  The top right corner of the first lame is broken through.  The lames of the neck-defence are connected to one another by five later internal leathers.  Attached by three later internal leathers within each side of the skull is a scutiform cheek-piece formed of four medially-ridged, downward-overlapping lames which are connected to one another by three later internal leathers.  The first lame, which is longer than the rest, is decorated with an almond-shaped boss and pierced with nine small, circular ventilations at its centre, and cut with a semi-circular notch at the level of the eyes at its front edge.  The main edges of the cheek-piece have plain inward turns.  The main edges of the peak and the neck-defence have plain inward turns accompanied by narrow grooves.  The upper edge of the peak, the lower edge of each side of the skull and the lower edges of the first to ninth lames of the neck-defence are in every case decorated with low cusps."]
