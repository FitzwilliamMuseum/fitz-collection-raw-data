Linen thread is worked in needle weaving, needle point lace filling stitches and holliepoint.  There is a plain selvedge at the top and bottom and the two sides are hemmed with yellow silk.  The sampler is made up of five bands of horizontal repeating floral border patterns which are followed by a wide pictorial band, completely covered in embroidery and depicting a tree flanked by 'boxers' with their coats semi-detached, stags, birds and insects.  Below that is a band divided vertically into three, also completely covered in embroidery with two all-over patterns either side of a stylized flowering tree with dogs and insects.  Next is a band of Florentine work and then a band of pink silk worked in counted satin stitch.  There are two more bands of cut and drawn work, the lower one including nine small panels of holliepoint.  The last three narrow bands carry the inscription 'RACHEL IARRATT HER/SAMPLAR FINISHD IVLY 4 176-/AGED 11YEARS'."]
