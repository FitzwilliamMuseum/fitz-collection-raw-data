At the centre, a young boy rides on the dog's back, grasping the chain attached to the collar around its neck, the dog turning its head to lick at the boy's face. An older girl holds the collar around the dog's neck to the left. A toddler standing in a baby walker at the far right plays with the dog's tail. The baby wears a padded roll around its head known as a \"pudding\" which was intended to protect the head in case of falls. Leading strings, designed to help guide a child in walking, are attached to the back of the baby's gown at the shoulders. An open door leads into a hallway on the right and four busts are arranged along the top of a decorative niche to the left."]
