The upper edge of the collar has a bold, file-roped inward turn.  The lower edge of the collar, which is nearly straight at the rear, and obtusely pointed at the front, has a plain, partial inward turn.  The lames of the collar are connected to one another by three modern internal leathers front and rear.  The front and rear sections of the collar are connected to one another by an internal hinge located at the left ends of the first lames, and fastened to one another by a circular stud and a hole located at the right end of the first lames.  They were formerly fastened to one another by a mushroom-shaped stud and keyhole-slot located at the right end of the third lames.  The mushroom-shaped stud is now missing.  The third lames have been directly riveted to one another at each side, making it impossible to open the collar.  The lames of the spaudlers are connected to one another and to each side of the collar by modern sliding-rivets at their rear ends, and by modern internal leathers at their front ends and centres.  The upper end of the front leather of the right spaudler terminates in a laterally-flattened mushroom-shaped stud that engages a slot cut in the lowest front lame of the collar.  The second lame of each spaudler is shaped to the point of the shoulder.  The sloping lower edge of the final lames of each spaudler has a file-roped inward turn.  The front end of the final lame is fitted with a single-ended tongue iron buckle that served to engage a strap formerly riveted at the rear end of the lames.  The front and rear edges of each spaudler have plain partial inward turns.  The upper edges of the lowest lames of the collar, and the lower edges of the final lames of the spaudlers have recessed borders with chevron-shaped projections at their centres"]
