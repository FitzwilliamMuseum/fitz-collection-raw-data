The images were made by Sean Caulfield and the corresponding texts were written by Jonathan Hart. This project were created through a collaborative process. The images were developed on intaglio plates using mezzotint, etching as well as digital printing and chine collé techniques. Some hand tinting was used. Digital images are based on the notebooks of Guido Miller, circa 1920. The typefaces are Dante, designed by Giovanni Mardersteig and Trajan, designed by Carol Twombly. The type was printed digitally. The images are printed on Hahnemuhle, Gampi and Honen papers and the texts on Hahnemuhle, Honen and Pegasus Text. Printing was done by Sean Caulfield. This edition is housed in a porfolio case covered in German book cloth. The case was produced by the Portfoliobox Company, Rhode Island.\" --colophon.\n\"The prints were produced in an edition of twelve along with artists' proofs. This edition of Lethe is limited to four numbered copies.\"--colophon.\nMuseum has copy no. 4 signed by Hart, Caulfield and Colberg."]
