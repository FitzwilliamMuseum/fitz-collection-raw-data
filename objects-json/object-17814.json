        "value": ["Pair of tassets, for field use. Each formed of nine transversely-curved, upward-overlapping lames that widen to its lower end.  Its inner edge curves inwards from the ninth to the second lames and then projects outwards again at the first lame.  The first lame has a short, transverse step at its inner end.  The ninth lame is deeper than the rest.  Each tasset has file-roped inward turns at its upper and lower edges, and plain, partial inward turns at its inner and outer edges, in each case accompanied by recessed borders.  The lower border contains seven modern round-headed lining-rivets with circular internal washers that retain a modern buff-leather lining-band cut from a strap.  The inner end of the first lame of the left tasset is restored.  The restoration is attached by a riveted internal patch.  A further riveted internal patch repairs the original upper edge of the same lame which is cracked at two points.  The upper edges of the second to ninth lames of each tasset are decorated with pairs of incised lines.  The lames are connected to one another at their inner and outer ends by modern round-headed rivets, and at their centre by modern internal leather cut from a strap.  The leather is secured to each lame by a single externally-flush rivet, except in the case of the ninth where it is secured by a pair of round-headed rivets with circular internal washers.  It is likely that the connecting-rivets at the inner ends of the lames replace a second internal leather.  The rivets, in that case, occupy the holes for the attachment of the leather, and the overlying construction-holes that were originally filled with purely decorative rivets.  The first lame of each tasset is fitted at either end with a double-ended, tongued, iron buckle.  Its rounded hasp is decorated peripherally with punched crescents, and its loops which are rectangular distally, and D-shaped proximally, are each decorated with file-roping.  Each buckle is retained by a single rivet which is externally-flush, except in the case of the inner one of the left tasset, which is round-headed.  A hole located just to the outside of the outer buckle of the left tasset is plugged with an externally-flush rivet.  Later holes pierced at the centres of the first to eighth lames of each tasset, have subsequently been similarly plugged.  They align with the underlying holes for the leathering-rivets and must at some time have served to rigidly secure the lames to one another.
