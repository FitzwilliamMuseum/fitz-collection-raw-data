      {
        "value": ["Burgonet, of 'Todenkopf' form, of great weight, for seige use. Formed of a two-piece skull with an integral neck-defence, a pivoted peak, and a pair of hinged cheek-pieces, each with an integral neck-defence, that fasten together at the front. The rounded skull is made in two halves joined along a low medial comb that is turned to the left, and along the centre of the neck-defence which has a hammer-welded overlap. The crest of the comb is decorated with close-set file-roping. The lower edge of the skull is flanged outwards to form a neck-defence of uniform depth all around. The lower edge of the neck-defence has a file-roped inward turn bordered by seven modern, brass-capped rivets that may either have been purely decorative, or perhaps have served to attach a lining. The front of the skull is cut away to form an arched face-opening that is strongly cusped over the centre of the brow. The face-opening is bordered by eight countersunk holes for lining-rivets. A further six such holes run around the nape. The hole to the left of centre at the brow is broken out to the edge of the face-opening. Attached by a small, round-headed pivot at each side of the skull is a peak that is flanged outwards and arched over each eye. The edge of each arch has a plain inward turn. The straight upper edge of the peak is bordered by a single incised line. It is shaped and roped medially to fit over and serve as a continuation of the front end of the comb of the skull. The lower edge of the peak is stepped at each side where it fits over the rear edge of the cheek-piece. The cheek-pieces are attached at each side of the skull by robust hinges that are secured at either end by pairs of externally-flush rivets. The rear end of each hinge, which is formed as a pair of lobes, is secured to the skull externally, while the front end, which has cropped and somewhat rounded corners, is secured to the cheek-pieces internally. The rear edge of the cheek-piece is shaped over the hinge. The heavily bevelled rear and upper edges of each cheek-piece form a continuous, convex curve. The front edge of the right cheek-piece overlaps the front edge of the left cheek-piece at its lower end. The front edges of the cheek-pieces are cut at their upper ends to produce a face-opening that takes the form of a large transverse oval at the level of the eyes, narrows over the nose and widens again to a smaller transverse oval at the level of the mouth. The heavily bevelled edges of the face-opening are decorated with file-roping accompanied by single incised lines. The incised lines continue downwards, over the chin, along the edges of each cheek-piece. The lower edge of each cheek-piece is flanged outwards to form a continuation of the neck-defence of the skull. The edge has a plain, inward turn accompanied in each case by three brass-capped rivets that may either have been purely decorative, or perhaps have served to attach a lining. Riveted at the inner end of the flange of the left cheek-piece is a pierced stud that is accommodated within a rectangular notch cut into the front end of the flange of the right cheek-piece and engaged by an iron swivel-hook secured by a round-headed rivet just behind the notch. The left cheek-piece is pierced just below its stud with a hole of uncertain function. The right cheek-piece is pierced at the side of the neck and at the brow with construction-holes that align with underlying holes in the skull for lining-rivets."]
