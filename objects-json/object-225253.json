A male figure (Daniel O'Connell, 1775-1847), in the left foreground, wearing a gown and wig, with battered hat perched on top and holding a wand aloft in his right hand. Five male figures stand before him on a cloud as if in a vision. From left to right, Curran (John Philpot Curran, 1750-1817), with printed speech in a bubble above: 'If any body desires to know what would be the conse- /quence of an union with Great Britain, I will tell him. It would be - the emigration of every man of consequence from / Ireland; It would be the participation of British taxes, / without British trade; It would be - the extinction of the / Irish name as a people.'; Grattan (Henry Grattan, 1746-1820), with printed speech in a bubble above: 'Let no country ever submit to be a / province that has strength enough / to be a nation.'; Saurin (William Saurin, 1757-1839), with printed speech in a bubble above: 'You may make the Union binding as a law, ... will be a mere question of prudence.'; Bish (Thomas Bish, 1780-1843), with printed speech in a bubble above: 'I see nothing in it, but one question- ... in a moment of our virtue'; Plunket (William Conyngham Plunket, 1st Baron Plunket, 1764-1854), with printed speech in a bubble above: 'I warn you - do not dare to lay your / hand on the Constitution ... and no man in the / Land is bound to obey you!'. The three judges seen fleeing in the right foreground have been identified as, from left to right: Chancellor Hart (Sir Anthony Hart, c.1754-1831), Bushe (Charles Kendal Bushe, 1767-1843) and Lord Plunkett (appearing twice in the same image) The artist's initials in monogram at lower right: 'HB'. Title printed below the border: THE DARRANANE CONJURER or MORE WIGS ON THE GREEN'. The publisher's details printed below: 'London: Published by Thos McLean, 26 Haymarket, Octr 7th 1830.'. Printer's details below the border at lower right: 'Printed by C. Motte, 23, Leicester Square.'. Handwritten in graphite at upper right: '86'. See 16283,_Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires_, Vol. XI, 1828-1832, M.D. George, published 1954, pp. 348. A number '[86]' printed in square brackets in the right-hand margin on p. 348 relates to the handwritten number at upper right, both referencing the sequence of John Doyle's Political Sketches series. P.14663-R is another impression."]
