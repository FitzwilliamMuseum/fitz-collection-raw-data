The nearly rectangular tassets are each formed in one piece and embossed to simulate six lames of which the lowest is the deepest.  The tassets widen slightly to their lower ends and have rounded lower outer corners.  Riveted at the upper edge of each tasset is a pair of elaborately-shaped and fretted hinge hasps of brass.  The L-shaped upper ends of the hasps are slotted and fitted with swivel-hooks to fit over and engage the studs riveted at the lower edge of the skirt of the breastplate.  The hasps are accurate modern restorations.  A later slot has been pierced at the upper edge of each tasset in line with the outer hinge.  Several later holes near the lower ends of the hinges have been plugged with rivets.\nThe main edges of the armour have plain inward turns.  The armour is decorated throughout with multiple bands and borders of 'terraced' form that project inwards at intervals as chevrons.  The bands are emphasised by single and pairs of incised lines.  The armour is decorated throughout with borders and lines of brass-capped rivets, most of which serve as lining-rivets. Part of the pikeman's armour HEN.M.22A-E-1933."]
