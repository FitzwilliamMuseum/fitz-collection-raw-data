        "value": ["Collar, for field use, composed of elements of a similar period and fashion. Formed of two upward-overlapping lames front and rear.  The top lame in each instance has a prominent inward turn at its upper edge.  There are traces of later removed file-roping.  The bottom lame in each instance is considerably deeper than the first lame.  The front one has a convex lower edge, and the rear one, a straight lower edge with strongly rounded corners.  The lower edge in each instance has a partial inward turn decorated with modern file-roping.  The turn is in each instance bordered by seven holes for lining-rivets.  Those at the front are occupied by modern round-headed rivets, all of which are of brass except the central one which is of brass-capped iron.  The turn of the rear lame is damaged at its right end.  The upper edge of the bottom lame in each instance is bordered by a pair of incised lines.  The top and bottom lames are connected to one another at their outer ends by modern, round-headed rivets of copper, except at the right of the rear section where the rivet is externally-flush and of iron.  The rivets at the left of both sections are fitted with square, internal washers.  The lames were originally connected to one another by three internal leathers front and rear.  The leathers were retained by single rivets, except in the case of the central ones which were in each instance attached to the top lame by a pair of rivets.  The rivets for the central right leather of the top front lame, and the central and right leathers of the top rear lame are preserved.  They are of externally-flush form and retain fragments of the leathers. The rivet-holes for the left leather in the top rear lame, and the central leather in the bottom rear lame are now vacant.  The rivet-holes for the outer leathers of the bottom rear lame are occupied by modern externally-flush rivets.  The rivet-holes for all three leathers of the bottom front lame are occupied by modern, round-headed rivets of brass, except for the left one which is of brass-capped iron.  The rivet-holes for the outer leathers of the top front lame are occupied by the rivets that now connect it to the bottom front lame.  These rivets now pass through construction-holes in the latter that were formerly occupied by independent round-headed rivets.  The corresponding construction-holes at the left and right ends of the bottom rear lame are now, respectively, vacant and occupied by a modern, round-headed copper rivet.  The vacant hole is cracked through to the upper edge.  The front and rear sections of the collar are connected to one another at the left side by a crudely-formed hinge secured within the top lame by an externally-flush rivet front and rear.  The front and rear sections of the collar are fastened to one another at the left side by means of a modern, mushroom-shaped stud of brass riveted to the bottom rear lame engaging a keyhole-slot in the corresponding front lame, and a small plain stud riveted to a  tongue-like projection of the top rear lame engaging a circular hole in the corresponding front lame.  The front and rear bottom plates are rigidly secured to one another at the left side by a modern, externally-flush rivet occupying a former construction-hole.  This now prevents the collar from being opened.  Secured by a rivet at the top of each shoulder of the bottom rear lame is a modern leather strap for the attachment of the pauldrons.  The rivet for the left strap is of brass with a round head and a circular internal washer of iron, while the rivet for the right strap is of iron with a flat head.\n Differences in workmanship and colour, together with the presence of redundant rivet-holes,  indicate that the top lames are associated with the bottom lames of the collar.
