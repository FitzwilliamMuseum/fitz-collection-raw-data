The breastplate is made in one piece with an upward-flanged neck-opening and a narrow flange at the waist.  Riveted at each arm-opening is a pierced stud and, to the inside of it, a swivel-hook that together serve to engage and secure the shoulder-straps of the backplate.  The positions of the studs and the swivel-hooks have been interchanged.  Secured at each side of the waist by a pair of rivets is a long hasp pierced with three holes to accommodate the studs riveted at each side of the backplate.  Riveted at each side of the waist-flange is a hinged hasp fitted with a bolt and square nut for the attachment of tassets.  The hasps are incorrect modern additions.\nThe backplate is made in one piece with an upward-flanged neck-opening and a narrow flange at the waist.  Attached by a pair of round-headed rivets at each shoulder is a scaled shoulder strap, with a long, elaborately-shaped terminal pierced with three oval holes to accommodate the pierced studs riveted at each side of the breastplate.  The shoulder- scales were originally continuous, with no gaps between them, producing heart-shaped piercings at their junctions.  Riveted at each side of the waist is a modern pierced stud and swivel-hook that together served to engage and secure the hasps riveted at each side of the breastplate.  The waist-flange is fitted with a pierced circular stud at its right end, and a turning-pin with a flat semi-circular head at its left end to attach a skirt.  The stud and the turning-pin are incorrect modern additions.\nThe main edges of the cuirass have plain inward turns. Part of the composite three-quarter armour HEN.M.19A-G-1933."]
