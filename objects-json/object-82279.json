The rocky base is approximately rectangular, with a heap of rocks on top of it on the left, and to the right of it, a tree stump covered by a drape. Here and there on the rocks are four groups of flowers and leaves, and six tufts of moss. A young girl playing a lute is seated on the heap of rocks. She is barefooted, and has her hair loosely drawn back into a bun. She wears a knee-length tunic which reveals her right side and arm. To the viewer's right of her is a nude winged putto standing on his left leg with his right extended behind. In his left hand he holds a piece of paper (presumably music) in front of the girl, and in his raised right hand, a scroll."]
