According to Father Brown, the original design by Pilgrim Wetton was made in ivory but after seeing a silver version in a Catholic bookshop, he commissioned Wetton to make a version in gold, costing 17 guineas. Father Brown has a long association with Cambridge, having studied Theology at Fitzwilliam College in 1953, when it was known as Fitzwilliam Hall and located on Trumpington Street, opposite The Fitzwilliam Museum. He later attended a Theological college near Oxford and was ordained at Guildford before working as a Senior Curate at St Nicholas, Chiswick. He subsequently worked as Chaplain at the Chelsea College of Science and Technology before moving to a parish church, St Saviours, in Sunbury Common."]
