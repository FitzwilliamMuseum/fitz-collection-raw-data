Of rounded, medially-ridged form, composed of a breastplate proper, covering the thorax, and an upward overlapping plackart, covering the abdomen.  The breastplate proper has bold, angular, outward turns at the neck and arm-openings.  The arm-openings are each bordered by three flutes which converge slightly before fading out at their upper and lower ends.  A pair of rivet-holes for the attachment of shoulder-straps is pierced at the top of each shoulder, while a pair of lace-holes is pierced at the centre of the neck-opening.  The upper edge of the plackart is decorated with five cusps, of which the central one terminates in a large leaf-shaped finial pierced at either side of its base with four decorative holes in lozenge formation.  The central and outer cusps are fitted with modern round-headed rivets and internal washers that secure the plackart to the breastplate proper.  The upper edge of the plackart is bordered at either side by three flutes that converge just below the central rivet.  The lower edge of the plackart is flanged outwards to receive a skirt.  The flange is pierced at each of its outer ends with a rivet-hole, and fitted at the centre with a pair of externally-flush rivets retaining a fragment of the internal connecting-leather."]

Gamber, Katalog der Leibr端skammer, Part I, F端hrer durch das Kunsthistorishes Museum, Vienna, No. 13, 1976, p. 85, pl. 29, Inv. No. A 183) which according to a tradition recorded as early as 1583, belonged to the Venetian, Bartolomeo Colleoni (1400-75).  The breastplate has Italianate etching at the borders, but in contrast to most pieces of Italian armour of the period lacks any marks.  Since the breastplate appears to be of an earlier period than the etched decoration, it may conceivably be a German piece that was later ornamented by its Italian owner."]
