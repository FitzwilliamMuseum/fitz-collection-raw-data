The book comprised eight categories: birds, plums, orchids, bamboos, fruit, stones, ink drawings (round fans) and miscellany. The leaves are printed on one side only; they were folded in half and glued together along the outer fold, and each image was followed by an accompanying text, in most cases a poem. This example has been taken out of its original binding. This image does not appear in the Universtiy Library's copy (the finest and only extant complete copy in the original binding of what he describes as the 'second superstate' of the first edition). There is a 'bird on plum branch, but it is from different blocks. Most probably a later addition, considering the wear and missing blocks in the other of the pages at the Fitzwilliam.
