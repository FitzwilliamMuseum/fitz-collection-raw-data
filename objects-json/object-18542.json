        "value": ["Zischägge, for light cavalry use. Formed of a skull with an integral peak, a sliding nasal-bar, a laminated neck-defence and a pair of laminated cheek-pieces.  The hemispherical skull is formed in two halves joined by a riveted overlap to the left, and is decorated with radiating flutes of V-shaped section.  The crests of the flutes are alternately roped and plain.  They are in every case bordered to each side by pairs of incised lines.  Screwed at the apex of the skull is a large, longitudinally-fluted, lemon-shaped finial with a washer at its base formed as six radiating leaves.  The broad, integral peak is slightly downturned and projects forward to an obtuse central point.  The rear of the peak is pierced with a central rectangular hole to accommodate a sliding nasal-bar which is retained at the brow of the skull by a rectangular staple and locking-screw.  The nasal-bar has a fleur-de-lis terminal at its upper end.  The nasal-bar and its staple appear to be modern restorations, but the locking-screw appears to be old.  A tapering tubular plume-holder decorated with roped mouldings at its upper and lower ends, and furnished with integral arms is riveted at the nape of the skull.  The lower edge of the skull is flanged outwards at the rear to receive the broad neck-defence of five upward-overlapping lames.  The lower edge of the neck-defence is centrally-pointed.  Each lame is decorated at its upper end with a series of cusps and ogees.  The lames are connected to one another and to the skull at their outer ends by modern round-headed rivets fitted in most cases with square internal washers.  Attached at the lower edge of each side of the skull by its leather lining is a tapering cheek-piece formed of three downward overlapping lames.  The upper lame is pierced with eight radiating keyhole-shaped ventilation-slots.  A leather loop is riveted within the lower end of each cheek-piece.  Differences in the colour and workmanship of the cheek-pieces suggest that they are modern restorations.\nThe main edges of the helmet have file-roped inward turns accompanied by brass-capped, round-headed lining-rivets which also encircle the base of the skull."]
