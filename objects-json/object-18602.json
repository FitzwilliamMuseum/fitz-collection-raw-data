The arm-openings and the neck-openings have plain inward turns accompanied by single incised lines.  The lateral edges of the skirt have plain inward turns accompanied by recessed borders.  Riveted at each side of the chest is a pierced stud and swivel-hook to engage and secure the shoulder-straps of the backplate.\nThe remains of modern shoulder-straps are incorrectly riveted at each shoulder of the breastplate.  Riveted at each side of the skirt is a pair of hinges that connect the tassets.  The hinges for the right tasset have nearly square terminals at their upper ends, and trefoil terminals at their lower ends.  The hinges for the left tasset have obtusely-pointed terminals at their upper and lower  ends.\nThe tassets are of trapezoidal form, widening slightly to their lower ends.  The right is embossed to simulate five lames.  The left is embossed to simulated six lames of which the last is longer than the rest.  The upper edges of the simulated lames are decorated with single incised lines.   The lateral and lower edges of each tasset have plain inward turns accompanied by recessed borders.  The inner border of the right tasset is stepped.  The borders of the right tasset are occupied by round-headed lining-rivets.  Both tassets are decorated with three vertical lines of round-headed rivets.\nThe tassets do not form an exact pair and are associated with the breastplate.  The tassets might conceivably be of slightly later date than the breastplate."]
