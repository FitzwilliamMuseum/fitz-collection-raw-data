        "value": ["Close helmet, for heavy cavalry use. Formed of a skull with a peak and bevor attached to it by common pivots, and a single gorget-plate front and rear.  The rounded skull is formed in two halves joined by a turn to the right along a low, roped medial comb that rises to a point at its apex.  The point was originally fitted with a finial, now missing.  The skull is decorated with radiating flutes of V-shaped section.  It is pierced with four ventilation-holes at each side and fitted with a plume-holder at the nape.  The pivots that retain the peak and bevor are modern.  Each consists of a screw with a rounded cross-cut, quatrefoil head and a square internal nut.  The nearly flat peak projects forward to an obtuse point and is decorated with a medial rib.  It is shaped at the brow to fit over the flutes of the skull.  The medially-ridged bevor is strongly shaped to the point of the chin and has a deep U-shaped face opening.  The face-opening is covered by a detachable, falling buffe of two downward-overlapping lames that is sprung over two studs projecting from the sides of the bevor at its lower corner.  The upper edge of the buffe is cut with a broad, shallow notch, forming the lower edge of a vision-slit.  The upper lame of the buffe is embossed below the vision-slit with a prominent, transverse belt that is cut with vertical ventilation-slots and decorated at its centre with a scallop-shell.  The lames of the falling buffee are each supported at the right of the chin by a sprung rectangular stud.  The helmet is fitted with a single gorget-plate front and rear, each of which is embossed to simulate two lames.  The lower edge of each curves down to an obtuse central point.  The gorget-plates are attached to the flanged lower edges of the bevor and skull by modern round-headed rivets with internal washers at each side.\nThe main edges of the helmet are decorated with file-roped inward turns, in most cases accompanied by recessed borders.  The borders of the gorget-plates rise to central cusps.  The subsidiary edges of the helmet are decorated with single incised lines."]
