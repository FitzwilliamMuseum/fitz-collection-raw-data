Formed of a one-piece skull, a broad flat peak, a sliding nasal-bar with a retaining staple and wing-headed locking screw, a broad neck-defence of four upward-overlapping lames and a pair of pendant cheek-pieces each of three downward-overlapping lames.  The hemispherical skull is decorated with sixteen radiating flutes of V-shaped sections, each decorated at its crest with file-roping and separated by three evenly-spaced, radiating incised lines.  The flutes descend to a recessed border with a vandyked upper edge.  The apex of the skull is surmounted by a radially-fluted conical finial riveted through a large, star-shaped washer.  The main edges of the obtusely-pointed peak and neck-defence each have file-roped inward turns.  The secondary edges of the neck-defence and the cheek-pieces are decorated with a series of filed ogees.  The cheek-pieces widen to their mid-points and then narrow again to their rounded lower ends.  Their upper lames have elaborately fretted ventilation-holes.  The sliding nasal-bar has an elaborately shaped and pierced finial. Part of the composite half armour HEN.M.16A-F-1933."]
