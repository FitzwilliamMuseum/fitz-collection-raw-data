The group is supported on a square base with four scroll feet with a pierced rocaille motif between the front two. The concave underside is glazed and has two holes at the back above the legs to take attachments, probably candle branches.\nA gallant and lady stand on the left and right of a fountain with an apsidal rockwork back and a central child's mask from whose mouth water spews into the curved basin below. Behind them there is a tree with three trunks linked by branches, covered with various types of applied flowers and leaves forming bocage. The top of the base between the figures is covered with applied flowers and leaves. The gallant leans against a small tree stump, standing on his left leg with the right leg forward and his left arm in front of him. He has a pink hat, a flowered jacked, striped breeches and pink shoes, and carries a bag slung on a strap across his body. The lady has a turquoise and blue hat, a pink bodice, a flowered skirt held up in her right hand, and blue shoes, and has a bag on her left hip. The fountain is painted in turquoise, pink, yellow, and grey. The flowers on the tree and base are painted in blue, yellow, dark pink, orange-red, and those on the top of the base are blue and pink and yellow and pink. The scroll feet and edges of the base are picked out in turquoise and gold."]
