          ["Tabernacle clock with hour striking and alarm movement. Anonymous clockmaker. Production Place: Germany. Dial: Replaced Silver chapter ring engraved I - XII in Roman numerals, quarter hour divisions on the inside, hour divisions on the outside and simple fleur-de-lys half hour marks. Within the chapter ring, a gilt brass alarm setting disc, with two holes for turning it, engraved ‘1 - 12' in arabic numerals with floral engraving in the centre. The ‘2's are the `Z' type suggesting German, probably Augsburg, manufactured for the Italian market. Substantial, possibly later, iron hand with an arrow-shaped pointer. Movement: Movement with hour striking and alarm, and of 30 hour duration. Iron frame with square decorated pillars and iron wheels except where otherwise stated. End to end trains, one behind the other. The spring barrels, flanged and with covers dove-tailed on, are of brass, the fusees also, with six turns cut for gut. The going train with brass contrate and crown wheels resulting from its conversion from balance to verge escapement with bob pendulum c.1700 or later. The pendulum now broken off short. A hole low down in the front of the case (now blocked) was provided originally for regulation by varying the set up of the mainspring. The striking arranged 1 - 6 on the Italian system, with a six hour count wheel indicator dial on the back of the case. The striking train with heart-shaped locking cam and released by a nag's head lifting piece. The alarm train with an open spring between four posts and a brass crown wheel to the verge. The going and striking wound at the back and the alarm wound at the left-hand side. Case: Mainly of copper gilt, but with the dome, finials and feet of gilt brass, with a rectangular section containing the movement, surmounted by a pierced dome enclosing the bell and with a splayed plinth. The ends of the rectangular section removable for access to the movement. The mouldings riveted in place but most of the assembly by means of screws. Engraved decoration, mostly floral with strap-work, but the plinth both chased and engraved. The chapter ring crudely riveted in position, a rough repair. Copper gilding (case), gilt brass dome, finials and feet, height 10 in, height 25.4 cm, circa 1600 — 1625."]
