          ["Figure of Aesop. Chelsea Porccelain Factory, England. The flat, unglazed underside has a circular ventilation hole at the back. The base is approximately rectangular with a broad tree-stump and rock rising up at the back. Aesop, shown as a black man with jet black hair and skin, a hump back and pot-belly. He stands on his right foot with his left knee bent, and the foot behind him, resting his posterior on the top of the tree stump. His head is turned slightly to his left, his right arm is raised, and his left arm is bent at the elbow so that the hand at chest level. He wears a pink jacket with a white collar and yellow lining, sixteen gold buttons, and a gold belt. His matching breeches have blue bows at the knees and he has yellow shoes with orange heels and brown soles. Across his body he wears a gold chain with a watch or medallion suspended over his right side. The tree stump is decorated with a few streaks of yellow and green. The top of the base is strewn with applied flowers and leaves: on the viewer's right, a pink flower with three leaves, three orange flowers with five leaves, and on the viewer's left,  two blue flowers with five leaves, and another pink flower with three leaves. Soft-paste porcelain, slip-cast (?), with semi-opaque lead glaze (presumably containing some tin-oxide), painted in blue, green, yellow, pink, dark pink, flesh, orange, and black enamels, and gilt. Height 24.7 cm, width 10.2 cm, depth 13.3 cm, 1755. Red anchor period (1752-1756). Rococo."]
