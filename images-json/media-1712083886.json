          ["Sculpture/Relief. The Adoration of Magi. The figures, dressed in sixteenth century costume, are grouped in an architectural setting with a vault over them. In the centre of the vault is a star surrounded by five cherub's heads, flanked by groups of a single angel and three angels reading. There are traces of blue paint in the vault. Below on the left, the Virgin sits on a cushion on a small trunk holding out the standing Christ Child on her left knee. Joseph stands behind her holding a string of beads (a rosary?). An elderly bearded and bareheaded King kneels to the right of the Virgin, holding out a covered vase to the Child. A second bearded King, stands behind him holding a covered cup, and a third, clean-shaven and more youthful stands on the extreme right holding a covered cup. In the spandrels at the top there are groups of leaves. The initials 'A.H. are carved by the Virgin's foot.. Alabaster, carved in high relief, with traces of dark blue paint, and gilding, height (whole) 78.5 cm, width (whole) 68.5 cm, depth (whole) 20.0 cm, circa 1540. Production Place: Malines. Flemish.
