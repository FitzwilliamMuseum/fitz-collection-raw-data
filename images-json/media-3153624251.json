          ["Valentine Card. Unknown British Maker. With moving part. An artist sits on a stool in front of an easel, painting with a brush held in his right hand, his palette held in his left. A printed verse below: \"I will not ask your doubtful skill, / I a portrait send of you, / They all are truths, this letter fill, / Both words and drawing too.\" When the tab is pulled, the artist's head moves up and down. The cutting out of the lithographed head is very roughly done. The inside pages are blank. This card was included in the exhibition of valentine cards, _For ever thine: the nineteenth century valentine_, held in the Charrington Print Room at the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1995, no. 73. From a series of moveable valentines which were possibly made by Windsor & Sons. The Glaisher collection contains six of these, four of which are mounted inside album P.14412-R on the same or adjacent album leaf. This card and one other (P.14360-R) were included in the 1995 Fitzwilliam exhibition, _For ever thine: the nineteenth century valentine_, but were originally mounted inside P.14412-R with the other cards from the series. Hand-coloured lithograph on 32mo-size white wove paper with an embossed border, 1840-1850."]
