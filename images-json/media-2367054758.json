          ["Print album. Valentine card/Changeable Valentine. S. Marks & Sons, publisher (British, Houndsditch, London). A hand-coloured lithograph on white wove paper with a cut-out figure of a young swell wearing fashionable clothes. The cut-out lifts to reveal the same figure wearing less showy and presumably cheaper attire. The window of a pawnshop is seen behind and to the right: \"MONEY LENT\" written above the window (backwards). A printed verse below: \"On Sunday you look very nice I must say, / But on Monday you have to put your things away ... Oh no my good Friend you can never be mine, / A Pawnbroker's Friend shan't be my Valentine.\" (209) printed below the image. The inside pages are blank. From a series of 15 Valentines with figures which lift to reveal their true characters which were bought at a sale, lot 590. See clipping from sale catalogue pasted to the album leaf below P.14345-R-54: \"Coloured Changeable Valentines of the 60's, pubd. by Marks, etc. ...\" This group of valentines was bought in 1923-24 from the bookseller, R.S. Frampton who was based at \"Walton House\", 37 Fonthill Road, Finsbury Park, London, N4. A Frampton sale catalogue from this date (No. 34) found in boxes containing Glaisher's valentines has lot 590 cut out from it. See P.14527-R. This fact can be verified by cross-referencing with an identical but complete book catalogue found among Glaisher's valentines, with the listing for lot 590 intact. See P.14528-R. Lithography, hand colouring, 1860-1870."]
