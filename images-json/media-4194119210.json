          ["Figure/Statuette. Production Place: Egypt. The prominent pubic triangle suggests that the figure was associated with fertility. Such representations were found in graves as early as the Middle Kingdom; during the earlier periods such objects were typically made from wood, clay, ivory or bone. A connection to fertility would explain why the subject is naked- this is extremely rare in Egyptian art. This figure has moveable arms, inlaid eyes (now missing) and once wore a headdress or crown, as indicated by the tenon on top of the head. The short wig identifies the subject as Nubian (southern Egypt or Sudan) and the rounded, broad face suggests that the female was African. The figure was hollow cast in several pieces and is in good condition. Copper alloy, body cast hollow in one piece, arms cast separately, obsidian pubic triangle inlay, height 21.8 cm, circa 747- circa 656 B.C. Twenty-fifth Dynasty."]
