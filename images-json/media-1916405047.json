          ["Creamware chocolate cup and saucer, with Minerva and emblems of Wisdom and Industry. Neale & Co., factory, perhaps, Staffordshire. Leeds Pottery, factory, perhaps, Yorkshire. The cup stands on a low footring from which its sides curve outwards and then almost vertically upwards to the rim; reeded double intertwined loop handle with flower and leaf terminals. The saucer has a low footring and deep, concave curving sides. The front of the cup and the centre of the saucer are transfer-printed with a medallion with a medallion enclosing a figure of Minerva, various emblems of Wisdom and Industry and the motto 'LET WISDOM UNITE US', flanked by trophies of game. The interior of the cup is painted with an eight-petalled, stylised flower. Borders on both cup and saucer are composed of a horizontal band from which run close, vertical lines of varying lengths so as to form a rough zig-zag below the band. Cream-coloured earthenware, transfer-printed overglaze and painted in jet black. Pale yellow lead-glaze, inclining towards green where it lies thickly within the footrings. The base and exterior of the cup are lightly crazed with a fine mesh. Height, cup, 6.8 cm, diameter, saucer, 12.6 cm, circa 1780. Rococo."]
