          ["English Delftware. Posset pot with cover and stand (see C.1504 & B-1928). Brislington Pottery, Somerset (possibly). The pot is bulbous, with wide neck and two handles branching into corkscrew coils and decorated with applied serpents; between them, on one side, is a sucking spout. On the cover, which is domed, is a knob in the form of an openwork globe with a bird perched upon it, flanked by handles similar to those on the pot. The pot and the circular stand each rest on three feet in the shape of small birds. The pot and the cover are painted with Chinese figures in landscapes, in the manner of late Ming porcelain; under the base the initials and date 'C T A 1685'. On the stand there is a man and woman in European dress drinking (perhaps intended as Lot and his daughters), with sun, moon and stars in the sky and the same initials and date '1686'. Buff earthenware, the body thrown, with applied handles, spout, feet, pierced knob and bird finial, covered with very pale turquoise-green tin-glaze, painted in blue. Height, whole, 31.1 cm, width, whole, 31.0 cm, dated 1685 (stand 1686). Baroque. Late Ming (manner of). Production Note: Previously uncertain whether the posset pot was Lambeth or Bristol. See Garner, 1972, in documentation, for attribution to Lambeth. See Archer, 2007 for attribution possibly to Brislington. The stand is catalogued separately because it has unrelated decoration, and may not originally have been with this posset pot."]
