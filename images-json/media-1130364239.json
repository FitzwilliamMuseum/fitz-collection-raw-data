          ["Delftware. Bird Cage. Production Place: Holland, Delft, United Provinces of the Netherlands. Circular, with six vertical shafts which rise above the top of the cage and end upwards in small castellated turrets; the bars arch inwards at the top and support a dome with a larger castellated turret in the middle. Round the base, and half-way up, are wide bands, painted in blue between the shafts with small landscapes with peasants skating and otherwise engaged, windmills, cattle and wherries. The shafts are painted with twining stems in blue and yellow. At one side is a door. Small receptacles for seeds and water, each in the form of a castellated turret painted in blue with cattle in a landscape, are inserted through openings on opposite sides of the cage. A chain hanging from the top inside supports a ring, on which is perched a yellow and purple parrot. Buff earthenware tin-glazed and painted in blue and yellow, height, whole 44 cm, width whole 36 cm, circa 1700-1720."]
