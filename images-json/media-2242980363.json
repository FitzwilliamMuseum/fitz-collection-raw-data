          ["Armour. Reinforcing bevor, for use in the tourney, with etched decoration. Unknown production, South Germany. Formed of a single, medially-ridged plate covering the lower half of the face and the point of the chin to which it is shaped. Its straight upper edge is cut with a broad, shallow notch to form the lower edge of a vision-slit. Its upper corners are rounded and pierced with small keyhole-slots to engage turning-pins. Its sides slope down and forward from the upper corners to a rounded junction at the point of the chin. The right side has a large, rounded cut-out. A small hole is pierced immediately below the rear end of the cut-out. The mid-line of the bevor shows severe rust-perforations and a split at its damaged lower end. The edges of the bevor, except at the vision-slit and cut-out, are etched with narrow bands of alternating scrolls on a blackened ground. The mid-line of the bevor is etched with adorsed scrolling foliage and tendrils issuing from a central stem, in part stippled and blackened, and in part bright. From the crudeness of its edge and the way that it cuts through the relevant decorative borders, it is possible that the cut-out at the right side of the bevor was enlarged during its working life. The cut-out at the upper edge of the bevor may also represent a later modification. Hammered, shaped, riveted, with etched decoration on a part blackened, part stippled, part bright background. Height, whole, 16.1 cm, maximum, width, whole, 22.0 cm, maximum, depth, whole, 12.8 cm, maximum, weight, whole, 0.33 kg, c. 1550. Provenance: From the armoury of the Princes Radziwill, Castle of Niescwiez, Poland."]
