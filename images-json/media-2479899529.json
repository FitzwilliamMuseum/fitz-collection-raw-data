          ["The Great War: Britain's Efforts and Ideals: Making Soldiers. Ready for Service. Kennington, Eric (British, 1888-1960). Ministry of Information. A three-quarter-length close-up view of a soldier who stands to attention facing right, the butt of his bayonet held in his left hand and resting against his left shoulder. The fur seen underneath the soldier's uniform is a reference to the goatskin jackets which were issued to British soldiers on the Western Front in late 1914, early 1915 to combat the severely cold Winter weather. A stack of bayonets can be seen in the right foreground and a group of soldiers at rest sketchily outlined in the background. Contained along with 6 lithographs inside a large portfolio (approx. 20\"x27\") of brown paper. A sheet with a central, red-printed rectangular box containing the stamp of the Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (George V) as used by HM Government followed by the title, 'THE GREAT WAR: / BRITAIN'S EFFORTS  / AND IDEALS / shown in a series of lithographic prints' / \"MAKING SOLDIERS\"  / Six subjects by / ERIC KENNINGTON / 13. \"Bayonet Practice\" ... 18. \"Bringing in Prisoners\". The capital 'A' printed at lower left is the insignia of the printers of the series, The Avenue Press. This is also seen on the label affixed to the mounts. The central box of the title page is pasted onto the front flap of the portfolio. Lithography, 1917."]
