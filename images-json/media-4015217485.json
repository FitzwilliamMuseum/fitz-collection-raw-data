          ["Sculpture/Figure. Christ at the Column. Della Porta, Guglielmo, after (Italian architect, sculptor and restorer; born Porlezza between 1500 and 1510; died Rome, 1577). The column, cut in half diagonally, is hollow. It is fluted with a degenerate Corinthian capital with a winged cherub's head centrally placed between the corner volutes. On the abacus is a rosette above the cherub's head. Two-thirds of the way down the column the fluting is replaced by large acanthus leaves springing from the base mouldings and carved in relief. The column stands on a plinth, which is plain. Against this column, his body turned in contraposto, leans the figure of Christ, his manacled wrists held out to the right of his hips. His body, naked except for a loin-cloth, is highly modelled and is slightly doubled up as if to protect itself from the blows. The bearded face is turned down to the left, his hair falling in ringlets on his shoulders. The remains of a halo can be seen on the crown of his head. Silver alloy, parcel-gilt, the figure and column cast separately, c.1600-1700. Rome, Italy. Renaissance."]
