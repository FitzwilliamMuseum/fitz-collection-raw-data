          ["Vessel. Clay flask, squat with tall neck, with wedjat-eye decoration in black and red. Clay (Nile silt B) flask thrown on a wheel in several parts and with a join at the base of the neck. The exterior is covered with a pink wash that has been applied with a brush. There is painted decoration in black and red on the shoulder of the vessel in teh form of bands and wadjet eyes. The wadjet eye represents the eye of Horus and is a traditional Egypt motif which combines a human eye with the wings of a hawk (Horus being a Hawk). It represents health and well-being and is used to protect people. The flask comes from a burial which contained cups and beakers. The colour of the wash imitates the pinkish colour of Aswan clay. the vessel has a rounded base and does not stand upright unaided. The pot is in several fragments and has been restored. Find Spot/Production Place: Qasr Ibrim, Nubia, Egypt. Clay, wheelmade, diameter 0.198 m, height 0.295 m, circa 301 - circa 400. Roman Period."]
