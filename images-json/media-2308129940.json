          ["Valentine card. Unknown publisher. A small cutwork valentine on white laid paper, folded in half with a panel of green silk inserted inside double-folded paper at the left side. The paper is cut around the panel in an arch with small circular perforations and scalloped design around the edges with cutwork winged heart at upper centre. The silk panel is mounted, in landscape format, with delicate cutwork silhouettes in gold and silver paper of a shepherd and shepherdess with sheep, trees to either side and Cupid with an arrow and two birds hovering above the couple. The opposite leaf is folded and cut away with cutwork design of a heart with wings flanked by bird's heads. Partial, cirular watermark. An inscription written in brown ink beneath: 'For / Mrs Anne Ithell / at Temple Dinsley / [?j]hoso [?p] E [superscript] fon[?t]'. Anne Ithell was the wife of Benedict Ithell (1670-1737), who had purchased the estate of Temple Dinsley in Hertfordshire in 1712. They had one daughter, Martha.
