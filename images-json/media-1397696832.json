          ["Koi. Shinsai, Ryûryûkyo (Japanese, active late 1780s-early 1820s). Surimono. Colour woodblock print with blind-embossing and metallic pigments. Signed: Shinsai. Circa 1820. Ukiyo-e. Notes: The idea of the Carp as a symbol of perseverance derived from Chinese literature, in which it was said that if the fish could successfully leap the last cataract - or ‘Dragon Gate’ - of the river, it was transformed into a Dragon. In Japan, passing the state examinations, on which promotion depended, came to be known as ‘leaping the Dragon Gate’. The carp was associated with Boys’ Day Festival on the fifth day of the fifth month, when Koi nobori (Carp Flags), which were carp-shaped balloons attached to bamboo rods and lines, were floated over the houses to encourage boys to rise to fame and fortune in emulation of the carp fighting its way up a waterfall. Porcelain figures were also made of carp ascending waterfalls (several are on display downstairs in the Lower Marlay Gallery). The carp became a popular subject in prints, where it was often depicted in the context of legendary young boys heroically overcoming difficulties."]
