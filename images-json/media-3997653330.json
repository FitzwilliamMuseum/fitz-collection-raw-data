          ["Snuff Box. Objets de vertu. Unknown, maker. The silver does not bear a maker's mark or hallmarks. Shell-shaped with straight sides. The slightly domed lid has stepped silver mounts, two projecting hinges and an arched thumbpiece. The top is decorated to resemble a shell with twelve ribs dividing the surface into thirteen panels. These contain stylised pendant flowers and, in the centre, a naked woman with a cherub on either side. On the base is an impressed plant shape, which would originally have contained a silver piqué ornament. The tortoiseshell was carved from a turtle shell, which was heated and pressed to form the parts of a box, which were glued together. The silver mounts were fitted round the rim of the box and the two hinges were attached with screws. The silver piqué was inlaid and engraved. Height, whole, 1.9 cm,  length, whole, 9.3 cm, width, whole, 6.8 cm, 1710-1740."]
