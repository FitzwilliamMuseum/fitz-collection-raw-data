          ["Engraved gems. Magical amulet. Obverse: The solar deity known as Abrasax, with its body placed frontally and head turned right. The deity has the head of a cock, the body of a Roman soldier dressed in cuirass and tunic, and legs formed from two-upward-curling snakes. In its left hand the anguipede holds a round shield and its right a whip. Seven stars are distributed throughout the field; two are placed above the anguipede, one to its right and four below on its left side. Surrounding is a legend. Reverse: a standing full-frontal, male figure with the head turned to the left, most probably the youthful Harpocrates. The god is wrapped in a himation: he carries a flail in his left hand and raises his right to his head, which is crowned with an over-large rendering of the opening lotus bud. Separated in the field are letters which spell the Gnostic magical name. Intaglio cutting, magnetite, 18* mm x 15 mm, circa 200-circa 400 AD. Roman Imperial."]
