          ["Sculpture/Figure. Seated Boy representing Autumn from a Set of Seasons, or the Infant Bacchus. Bertos, Francesco, probably (Italian, act.1693-1733). The plump, nude putto decked with vine tendrils and several bunches of grapes, is shown in arrested motion, with his head sharply twisted, and a highly-focused gaze. Propped up by his left arm, with his weight on his left buttock, he reclines rather unsteadily, as if paused in mid-crawl, his legs bent in a zigzag formation, the left one pulled well forward to the right. He grasps a large bunch of grapes in his extended right hand, whilst, apparently inadvertantly, crushing another bunch under his left buttock, and a third beneath his left palm. Copper alloy, probably bronze, cast, height, whole, 22.5 cm, length, whole, 29.5 cm, circa 1700-1733. Baroque. Production Note: Made in Padua or Dolo."]
