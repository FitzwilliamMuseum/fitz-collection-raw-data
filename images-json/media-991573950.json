          ["Miniature (painting). Box. Objets de vertu. George Frideric Handel 1685-1759. Craft, William Hopkins, miniaturist, after (British, op.1774-, d.1805). Unknown box maker, England. The turned circular box has straight sides which evert slightly at the lid and base. The pull-off lid (A) is almost flat; set in the centre, in a gilt metal mount, is an oval portrait miniature of George Frideric Handel. The composer faces three-quarters to the left, and wears a long full-bottomed wig. His stock is largely covered by his dull purple coat which has a gold lace border. The background is brown to purple. The interior of the box was painted green, but most of the paint has crumbled. Set inside the lid is a circular brass plaque inscribed 'This Box / surmounted by a Miniature / of / George Frederick Handel / (by his Cotemporary (sic) Zincke / was presented to the Committee of / the / Sacred Harmonic Society / the true Conservators of the Fame of that / illustrious Musician / by / J.N. Harrison, B.A., / Caius Coll Camb / (one of its earliest Members / MDCCCXLI'. The case (B & C) is circular with fluted sides and the pull-off lid is carved with raised concentric rings. The interior is lined with red velvet. Inside is a pamphlet (D) titled: 'A FEW FACTS / IN THE / LIFE OF HANDEL / BY / WILLIAM HUTCHINS CALLCOTT. / EXTRACTED FROM HIS MUSICAL WORK / \"The Handel Album\" / WITH ADDITIONAL ANECDOTES / \"We desire to know everything about a great man.\" / Schoelcher's Life of Handel / LONDON / LONGMAN, BROWN & CO., PATERNOSTER ROW, / AND C.
