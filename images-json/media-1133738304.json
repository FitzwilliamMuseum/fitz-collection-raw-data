          ["Maiolica. Shallow dish on low foot. The Judgement of Paris. Avelli, Francesco Xanto (Italian, act.1530-1542). Raimondi, Marcantonio, after (Italian, 1470/1482-1527/1534). Caraglio, Giovanni Giacomo, printmaker, after (Italian). Shape 78 with a groove around the edge of the foot. Circular with shallow upturned sides and flat centre, standing on a low foot. The Judgement of Paris. Venus, Juno and Minerva stand beside a gnarled tree on the left, accompanied by Cupid who tugs at Venus' drapery as she extends her left arm to receive the apple of discord from Paris, seated at the base of a rocky cliff on the right. He holds a crook upside down in his left hand and offers Venus the apple with his right. In the foreground there is grass and a tree stump; in the background, the sea shore and a hill town. Suspended from the branch of a tree growing out of the rocks above Paris, there is a shield of Tuscan form bearing the arms vert, a fess or, a chief party per pale gules (shown orange) and argent two rosettes counterchanged flanked by `Eli:' and `PYA'. The edge is yellow. The reverse is inscribed in dark blue near the edge with 'IVDITIVM PARIDIS.MANET ALTA MENTE REPOSITVM' and in the centre '.1531.Per cui Troia superba fu/combusta./Favola./Fra(n)cesco Xanto,Avelli da/Rovigo,i Urbino/pi(n)se. Pale buff earthenware, tin-glazed overall; the reverse beige and speckled. Painted in blue, green, yellow, orange, stone, brown, manganese-purple, black, and white. Height, whole, 5.0 cm, diameter, whole, 26.0 cm, dated circa 1531. Renaissance. Production Note: The figures were derived from three engraved sources, all used repeatedly by Xanto. The goddesses were adapted from Muses in the Contest between the Muses and the Pierides by G.G. Caraglio after Rosso Fiorentino. Paris was adapted from Apollo in Parnassus by Marcantonio after Raphael. Cupid may be a reversed image of the one in the Judgement of Paris by Marcantonio Raimondi after Raphael."]
