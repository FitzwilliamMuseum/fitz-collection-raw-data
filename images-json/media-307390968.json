          ["Asahi Shogun Yoshinaka Katsushika nijushiko (Twenty-four Generals for the Katsushika Group). Gakutei, Yashima (Japanese, 1786(?)-1868). Surimono. Colour print from woodblocks, with metallic pigment and blind embossing. Early 1820s. Ukiyo-e. Poetry by Bunrensha Takizumi and Bunseisha Harushige. Notes: From the series Katsushika nijushiko (Twenty-four Generals for the Katsushika Group). General Kiso no Yoshinaka (1154-1184) was the son of Minamoto no Yoshikata and grandson of Tameyoshi. He raised a rebellion against the Taira clan and in 1180 threw the Taira Governor out of Kyoto. In turn he was defeated by Yoshitsune, and when fleeing the capital his horse sank into a bog and Yoshinaka was shot in the forehead by a pursuer. Yoshinaka’s wife, Tomoe Gozen, was a legendary warrior in her own right and accompanied her husband into battle. She appears with him here, and in two other prints in this exhibition. After Yoshinaka’s death, she lived with another warrior, Wada no Yoshimori."]
