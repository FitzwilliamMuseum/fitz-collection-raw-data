          ["English Delftware. Bowl with scalloped edge. Redcliff Back pottery, probably, England, Somerset, Bristol. Frank, Richard, proprietor. The bowl has a shaped rim with alternately single and smaller double scallops around it, a narrow slightly sloping rim, deep curved sides, and a stands on a footrim formed by recessing the base. The well is painted with a river scene with two men in a narrow boat in the foreground and one man in a smaller boat on the left. Behind them is a group of houses, trees, bushes and two distant volcanoes. Overhead there are a few clouds, four birds on the left and one or two on the right. On the reverse there are two small peg marks on the edge of the rim, and a small flaw in the glaze on the back of the well, probably where the other peg was situated. Buff earthenware, moulded, trimmed, tin-glazed greyish-white and painted in blue; the glaze has a few pinholes on the rim; on the reverse there are two peg marks near the edge, and faint signs of another on the back of the well. Height, whole, 3.3 cm, diameter, whole, 17.7 cm, circa 1760-1770. Sir Ivor and Lady Batchelor Bequest through The Art Fund."]
