          ["Maiolica. Dish. Umbria, Deruta. Shape 63. Circular with narrow, slightly sloping rim, shallow curved sides and almost flat centre, standing on a low footring. The well is decorated with a symmetrical arrangement of grotesques, divided by four curved yellow frames with orange stripes. On the sides are slanting blue squiggles alternating with vertical strokes and, above and below, a yellow band with orange stripes. The rim is decorated with similar grotesques, separated by pairs of curved frames. The rim is yellow with orange stripes. Buff earthenware, tin-glazed overall; the reverse off-white. Painted in blue, green, yellow, orange, and manganese-purple. Height, whole, 5.6 cm, diameter, whole, 41.7 cm, circa 1600-1650. Mannerist. Production Note: The dish was accessioned as Urbino, late sixteenth century. However, the form of the grotesques, which terminate in comma-like scrolls filling in the background, indicate that it was more likely to have been made at Deruta during the first half of the seventeenth century."]
