          ["Guan yu. Gakutei, Yashima (Japanese, 1786(?)-1868). Surimono. Colour print from woodblocks, with metallic pigment and blind embossing. Mid 1820s. Poetry by Sanzuntei Kusami, circa 1824-circa 1826. Ukiyo-e. Notes: From a set of Shoku sanketsu (Three heroes of the State of Shu). Guan Yu, identifiable by his long beard, is one of the three Chinese generals who fought for the State of Shu (modern Szechuan Province) in the 4th century a.d. (see also the next print). Their tale was best known through the Chinese novel Romance of the three kingdoms which was introduced into Japan in the early Edo period and is still popular today. This series shows one of the most popular episodes in which the three generals meet in a peach orchard to drink and pledge their brotherhood. The poem reads: ‘The wine in the peach orchard lasts as long as Guan’s lovely beard and the beautiful spring day.’"]
