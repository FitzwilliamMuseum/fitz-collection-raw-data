          ["Weapons. Rapier. Palumbo, Onofrio (Italian, act. mid 17th century).\nProduction: Spanish - Neopolitan. Large, well-formed button-shaped pommel with a prominent tang-button. Knuckle-guard and long straight quillons of circular section, all neatly chiselled with a spiralling ribbon pattern. The knuckle-guard terminates against the side of the pommel with a broad, flat button. Similar terminals are at each end of the quillons. There is a very wide, strongly shaped cusped ecusson, deeply chiselled with a springing and scrolling floral design. There is a pair of branches enclosed within the deep spherical cup-guard. This is rimmed with a roped border, below which the entire cup is chiselled à jour with the customary scrolling floral patterns common to most of these cup-hilt rapiers of Spanish fashion. In the case, the scrolls of foliage enclose apparent thistle-heads. The garda polvo, generally an exquisitely chiselled plate, is here merely a flat iron disc bolted on to the ends of the branches. At the bottom of the cup, on the outside is a circular panel (through the centre of which the blade joins) with a ribbon design incorporating the legend LAURENTIUS PALUMBO DE NAPOLI FECIT. The bottom of the cup, just above this panel is broken away, showing the edge ? replaced garda polvo. Blade of multiple section; diamond from the joint to halfway up, turning there to flat hexagonal. There is a short, narrow fuller on each side occupying 15.4 cm (6\") of the flat of the blade, which above turns to a flat section. Strong ricasso, its lower half showing below the cup-guard. There is a maker's mark stamped on one side. Grooved blade inscribed 'I.N.R.I. & Maria'. Steel sword, cast, with a grooved blade and chiselled decoration, length, whole, 118.1, cm, length, blade, 100.7, cm, width, quillons, 25.7, cm, length, hilt, 16.5, cm, circa 1650-1660."]
