          ["Delftware. Butter dish and cover/butter tub. The White Star Factory, United Provinces of the Netherlands, Holland, Delft. Berg, Dirck van den, proprietor of factory. The circular, tub-shaped butter dish has horizontal reeding at the top and bottom of the sides, and two upright pierced arch-shaped lugs on opposing sides. The very slightly convex cover has shallow rectangular indentations cut in the edge to accommodate the lugs, and a vertical shaped handle with a rectangular hole in the lower edge. The sides of the tub are decorated with a continuous landscape with buildings and trees. On one side a man is walking to the left holding a staff in his right hand. On the other side, two farm labourers are raking hay, and there are three haycocks in the background. Each lug is decorated with a rosette. The upper half of the top of the cover is decorated with a building on the right, and a man walking to the left between two trees. The lower half has three haycocks, two men raking hay, and on the right, a a girl holding a rake. On the base is the factory mark. Tin-glazed earthenware painted in blue, height, whole, 6 cm, diameter, base, 11 cm, diameter, whole, 13 cm, circa 1776-1793. Production Note: The White Star Factory (De Witte Ster) operated in Delft between 1660 and 1804. The mark on this butter dish appears to be that used during the directorship of Dirck van den Berg between 1776 and 93."]
