          ["Poet preparing ink. Gakutei, Yashima (Japanese, 1786(?)-1868). Surimono. Colour print from woodblocks, with blind embossing (karazuri). Semmen-ban. Signed: Gakutei. Seal: Yashima. Poets: Bunsô (Fumimado) Takemasa(?) and Ise no Hamaogi, circa 1820-circa 1829. Ukiyo-e. Notes: Spring kyôka surimono commissioned by poets from the Go group. The unusual fan format occurs in only five known fan surimono, which are all by Gakutei. This and another fan surimono with a similar signature show Heian period court poets, and may be from a series of three depicting the set of three divine waka poets, in this instance Ono no Komachi (834-80). Komachi was the daughter of the governor of Dewa province and the adopted daughter of the poet Ono no Takamura. She was renowned for her beauty as well as her poetry, and scenes from her life were made famous in many plays from the 14th-century onwards; these were often depicted in prints. She was also one of the Rokkasen (Six immortal poets) depicted in the adjacent print."]
