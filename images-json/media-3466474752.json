          ["Miniature painting. Snuff box/Objets de vertu. Unknown Man. Rouquet, Jean André, miniaturist (1701-1758), attributed. Unknown box maker. Red lacquer, lined with tortoise shell, mounted in gold and set with a portrait miniature painted in enamel on copper. The circular box has straight sides and a flat pull-off lid. The top of the lid is set with an oval miniature of a young man with powdered hair wearing a straw hat with a posy of flowers at the front. He has a pink waistcoat and a white jacket edged with pink, and his hair is tied with a pink bow. Round the miniature and the edge of the lid and base are openwork mounts chased or stamped with flowerheads and pierced leaves. The rim at the join of the lid and base are mounted in gold and the deep bezel has a wavy edge. Height, miniature, 4.2 cm, width, miniature, 3.5 cm; height, box, 3.3 cm, diameter, box, 6.3 cm, after 1740- before 1758. French. Louis XV. Notes: Jean André Rouquet was a French Huguenot who worked in Switzerland and England before returning to work in Paris. He died before the box was made, so the miniature was not painted specifically for this box. When the box was accessioned the portrait miniature was thought to be of Louis XVI."]
