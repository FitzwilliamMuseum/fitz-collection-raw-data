          ["Weapons. Sword. Unknown maker, England. Blackened hilt. Long pod-shaped pommel, fluted. No button. Knuckle-guard of vaguely oval section, the top flattened, turned up through a right-angle and screwed into the side of the pommel; it widens at midpoint, where a loop-guard springs from it on each side to join the top of a shallow cup-guard. The ends of the loop-guards are scrolled towards the forward quillon. Short quillons, curled over towards the blade in tight spirals. The back of the hilt is a mirror image of the front. There is a massive quillon-block bluntly joined and incised with lines rotating from that point. The cup-guard is coarsely decorated with overlapping scale-shaped motifs, each pieced à jour with circular holes. The upper edge is decorated with a scalloped frill, and pressed à jour. The grip which is original has lost all its binding except for Turks' heads at top and bottom; it is of dark wood, swelling in the middle and facetted vertically with eight faces. Long tapering blade of flattened diamond section, the faces hollowed with a strong shoulder below the hilt. There are traces of engraved decorative motifs along the forte, but these are too worn to be identified except for a small floral piece just below the guard. Norman, hilt type 87. Steel sword, cast, with etched blade, blackened hilt, wood grip, fluted pommel and incised quillon-block, length, whole, 110.9 cm, length, blade, 96.5 cm, width, below hilt, 3.0 cm, circa 1640-1660."]
