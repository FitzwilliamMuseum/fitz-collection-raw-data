          ["Jug.  New Hall Porcelain Factory, Staffordshire, New Hall. With a hunting scene and a leaf and berry border painted in polychrome enamels. The bulbous jug stands on a low foot, and has a short cylindrical neck with a projecting lip. The strap handle is moulded with leaves in relief, and has a projecting finger rest near the lower end. On the sides, two men on horseback are galloping to the left towards a deer attacked by hounds beside a tree, and another man on foot who is brandishing a whip in one hand and holds the reigns of his horse in the other. On the other side is his horse trotting to the right, and behind it, two trees with a stylized flowering plant between them. Round the neck there is a continuous black stem bearing paired green leaves and paired black stalks with three red berries on each. The leaves on the back of the handle are outlined in black and have black dotted central vein. Bone china, moulded with decoration in relief, painted overglaze in blue, green, yellow, red, brown and black enamels, height, whole, 8.5 cm, length, whole, 12.5 cm, circa 1818-1825."]
