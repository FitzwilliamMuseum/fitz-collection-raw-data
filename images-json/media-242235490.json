          ["Weapons. Rapier. Unknown maker, Spanish and Italian. Small button-like pommel, with a large well-formed tang-button. Wire-bound grip of oval section swelling slightly in the middle with plain steel collars top and bottom. Strongly arched knuckle-guard of circular section, the top end fashioned as a button-shaped knob of the same form as the pommel; at the midpoint are two opposed flat button-shaped elements with sharp ridges on either side. Long straight quillons, also of circular section, the tips finished en suite with the knuckle-guard. Deep cup-guard, decorated with a circular pattern of scrolling leaves around the bottom of the half-globe, where the blade enters the cup. This cup-guard is fastened to the branches with a screw on either side of the hole through which the blade passes. This hole is rectangular, with one each of the longer sides (in the plane of the blade) a small cutout to accommodate a long narrow steel spike protruding from the top of the scabbard. Inside the cup is a finely-wrought garda polvo, in the form of a solid circular plate with a pattern of scrolling leaves chiselled in relief, edged with a kind of frill of lace-like elements pressed à jour. Instead of true branches, a narrow steel rib runs upward from the Garda Polvo to the point where the quillons cross the top of the cup. The ribs are chiselled in a zig-zag pattern and terminate in circular shell-like plates above trefoils. Blade of very strong triangular section with a deep narrow fuller at the forte. This is inscribed, on the obverse XX MI SINNAL X SANTISMO X CRUCIFICIO XX' followed by a small mark, and on the reverse 'XX ENRIQUE COLL X ESPADERO X IN X ALAMANIA X.'. Scabbard of wood covered with leather. At the top, a steel locket underneath the leather covering with a tubular fitment on the side to take a belt-hanger of steel. This consists of a D-shaped element with a long rod of circular section parallel with and below the upright of the D, which fits into the tube on the scabbard. Pivoted to the midpoint of the D is a short arm ending in a circular buckle. Small chape of plain steel finished with a double moulding and a knot. Norman hilt type 100. Steel sword, cast, with chiselled in relief decoration, wire grip, leather and steel scabbard, length 111.5 cm, blade 98.2 cm, quillons 30.7 cm, c.1700."]
