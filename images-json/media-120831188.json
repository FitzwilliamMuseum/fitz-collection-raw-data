          ["Maiolica dish, painted in polychrome with Mount Parnassus, Apollo, Euterpe and Erato. Milan Marsyas Painter, probably, Italy, The Marches, Urbino. Shape 55. Circular with broad, sloping rim, shallow well and convex centre. Parnassus. In the middle, Apollo sits playing a lyre in front of three trees. On the left, the Muse Euterpe sits holding a trumpet, and on the right, the Muse Erato, holding pipes. On each side a poet stands beside a tree; the one on the left looks away from the central group, the other towards it, holding his right index finger to his lips. Behind the figures there is a landscape and below, a window frame. On the upper right side there is a shield of Tuscan form, charged with the arms azure, an eagle displayed argent. The edge is yellow. Pale yellowish buff earthenware, tin-glazed overall. There is a fault in the glaze on the left of the rim and on the reverse it is pale beige and thinly applied. Painted in blue, green, yellow, orange, brown, black, grey, and white. Height, whole, 4.1 cm, diameter, whole, 30.7 cm, circa 1530-1531. Renaissance. Notes: The scene was derived from the engraving by Marcantonio Raimondi after a preparatory drawing by Raphael for his fresco of Parnassus, in the Stanza della Segnatura in the Vatican. All the figures other than Apollo, two Muses and two poets have been omitted; the trees and, curiously, the window frame, have been retained, and a landscape background has been inserted."]
