          ["Onoe Kikugorô III as Shimbei in Sukeroku yukari no Edo zakura (Sukeroku’s affinity for the cherry blossoms of Edo). Kunisada, Utagawa (Japanese, 1786-1865). Surimono. Colour prints from woodblocks, with metallic pigment and blind embossing (karazuri). Shikishiban. Signed: Kôchôrô Kunisada ga, with artist’s double toshidama seal (left sheet). Poets: Ryûkatei Fûshi Mizugaki and Ryûôtei Hananari (right) and Ryûôtei Hananari (left). c.1830. Ukiyo-e. Notes: Two sheets from a set of five showing a scene from one of the Eighteen Plays (Kabuki Jûhachiban) selected by Danjûrô VII as specially associated with the Ichikawa lineage of actors. The missing central sheet shows Danjûrô VII in the role of Sukeroku. The missing outer sheets show the villain Ikyû (right) and the noodle-seller Fukeroku (left). The print was probably made in connection with a performance planned in Osaka for New Year of 1830. The actors’ journey from Edo is reflected in the imagery of the poems. However, Iwai was summoned back to Edo by the city administration (machi-bugyo), as he was being sued by the head of the Ichimura theatre, so the performance could not take place as planned. Sukeroku is in reality Soga no Gorô, while Shimbei the sake seller is actually Gorô’s gentler elder brother, Soga no Jûrô (he wears a costume decorated with the Jûro’s flying-plovers pattern). Sukeroku learns that his missing heirloom sword Tomokirimaru is in the possession of Ikyû, the patron of Sukeroku’s secret lover Agemaki, who is a Yoshiwara courtesan (see P.501-1937). He subsequently wins the sword back in a fight in which Ikkyû is killed, and escapes with the help of Agemaki. A poem on the sheet depicting Kumesaburo alludes to irises, one of the actor’s symbols, while the reference to Edo purple (murasaki) also alludes to the purple headband worn by Sukeroku in this play: ‘Lovely coloured strands of iris flowers, purple as Edo, flow in streams to Naniwa [Osaka] and knot Agemaki’s robes.’ One of the poems on the sheet depicting Kikugorô puns on an allusion to plum blossom (bai), which is associated with Osaka and also forms the first character of Baikô (‘Plum luck’), the actor’s poetry name: ‘His beauty like an alluring fragrance drifts to another place; our elder brother flourishes in the Naniwa [Osaka] spring.’ The other poem puns on his family name Onoe, which means ‘peak’, while the mention of sake alludes to Shimbei’s guise as a sake seller: ‘Admired by all - the best in three capitals! - Onoe, like the peak of Fuji covered with snow made of white sake.’"]
