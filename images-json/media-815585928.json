          ["Dagger and Scabbard (khanjar). The blade is straight and double edged, fretted with two slots at either side of a medial serpent, and around a lotus bud. The blade is set with four emeralds and five rubies at either side of the forte, and decorated overall with floral panels and inscriptions in thick gold koftgari. The blade bears the date 'sanat 1121'. The hilt comprises a bulbous grip in shagreen, with a medallion of small diamonds in a gilt setting at the centre. The guard has small forward curved quillons set with various stones and gilded, and a pommel beaked at either side, enamelled in blue, red, pink and yellow in a white ground. The scabbard is of wood covered with shagreen, with large top locket and chape decorated in the same enamel, the chape with a large finial gilt with dark blue and turquoise enamel. Length (whole) 410 mm, width (blade) 270 mm, scabbard 310 mm, weight 280g. Blade 18th Century (1709-10), Turkish hilt & scabbard 19th Century. Turkish, Persian. Production Note: The diamond inscription was previously interpreted as 'Sultan Sa’id' but in fact reads, 'Sultan Selim'. This may refer to Sultan Selim III (r. 1789-1807). As the blade is dated 1121 AH (1709-10 CE), it seems likely that the blade was re-hilted (a not uncommon occurrence with blades considered special) during Sultan Selim III’s reign at the end of the 18th century."]
