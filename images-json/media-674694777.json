          ["Textiles. Bordered sampler. Gellet, Susanna (English). Embroidered with polychrome silks in cross, satin, counted satin and stem stitch. A narrow free-style floral border surrounds the sampler, which is divided into six horizontal sections by repeating geometric and floral border patterns. There is a wide pictorial lower section with a red brick house, steps and a lawn, flanked by trees, birds, flowerpots, a woman on the left and a man with a dog on the right. Centrally placed at the top, is an angel with a trumpet; lower centre a flower basket and below a leafy panel inscribed ' Susanna Gellet/May the 7/1800 flanked by flower baskets. Of the five embroidered verses one is placed centrally with detached floral motifs either side, the others symmetrically to the left and right. They read 'The Holy feast of Easter was injoind. / to bring Chrst's Resurrection to our mind./ rise then from Sin as he did from the Grave./ that by his Merrits he your Souls may save./', 'The Desire/ From my Beginning may the Almight Power./ Blessings bestow in never-ceasing Shower./ Oh! may I happy be and always blest!/ Of evr'y Joy, of evr'y Wish possess'd! / May Plenty dissipate all Worldly Care/ And smiling Peace bless my revolving Years.' 'Advice/ Learn to contemn all Praise betimes For flattery is the Nurse of Crimes With early Virtue plant they Breast/ the specious Arts of Vice detest', 'Virtue/ Virtue's the chiefest Beauty of the Mind/ The noblest Ornament of Human kind/Virtue's our Safeguard and our guiding star/ That stirs up Reason when our Senes err.', 'On Death/ Death at a Distance we but slightly fear. He brings his Terrors as he draws more near:/ Through Poverty, Pain, Slav'ry, we drudge/on, / The worst of Beings better please than none:/ No Price too dear to purchase Life and/ Breath, / The heaviest Burthen's easier borne than Death'. Wool, embroidered with polychrome silks. There is a double blue line selvedge at both sides and the top and bottom are hemmed with blue silk. Length 44 cm, width 32.5 cm, 1800."]
