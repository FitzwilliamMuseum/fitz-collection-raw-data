          ["Figure. Youth in Antique Dress, probably representing Autumn. Bow Porcelain Manufactory, Essex, Stratford-le-Bow. The rounded rectangular base has five scroll feet with a pierced rocaille motif between the front two. The front is decorated with applied flowers and leaves. On the viewer's left there is a tall square pedestal on top of which is a basket filled with fruit and foliage. The youth stands beside the pedestal with his right leg in front of his left. His left shoulder is forward and under his left arm he holds up a garland of flowers, which descend to the ground. He leans back slightly on his left arm, which rests on top of the basket. His cheeks are ruddy and he has a wreath of fruit over his black hair. He wears a long drape with a dense pattern of blue and red flowers on a pink and gold ground, and an orange lining, and over it, a pale purple cloak with a blue lining which passes over his left shoulder and down to the ground at the back. The pedestal is marbled in shades of purple, and has gold lines round the panels and edges. The basket is yellow and the fruit and flower garland polychrome. The base is picked out in purple, turquoise and gold. Soft-paste porcelain containing bone ash, press-moulded, with hand-modelled details, painted over lead-glaze in blue, green, yellow, orange, pale purple, and brown enamels, and gilt. The underside has slightly turquoise tinted glaze, and a large central circular ventilation hole. Height, whole, 30.0 cm, width, whole, 16.0 cm, circa 1765-1770. Rococo."]
