          ["Ashikaga Takauji Katsushika nijushiko (Twenty-four Generals for the Katsushika Group). Gakutei, Yashima (Japanese, 1786(?)-1868). Surimono. Colour print from woodblocks, with metallic pigment and blind embossing. Poetry by Bunteisha Shizumaru and Bunmeisha Nukimaru, circa 1820- circa 1823. Ukiyo-e. Notes: From the series Katsushika nijushiko (Twenty-four Generals for the Katsushika Group). Ashikaga Takauji (1305-1358) was the eldest son of Ashikaga Sadauji, a descendant of the Minamoto. In the dispute for the sucession between the Emperor Go-Daigo and the Hojo, he lead the Hojo troops but then changed his allegiance to the Emperor in order to avenge the murder of an ancestor who was killed by a Hojo. When he was inadequately rewarded by Go-Daigo, Takauji entered into open revolt against the Emperor and fought famous battles against Nitta Yoshisada. In 1336 he captured Kyoto and proclaimed Yutahito Emperor. He was the first Ashikaga Shogun, a dynasty that lasted until 1573. He is shown here with his general and first minister Kono Moronao, who was later adopted as the villain of the popular Chûshingura revenge story."]
