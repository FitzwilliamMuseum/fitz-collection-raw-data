          ["Furniture. Chippendale, Thomas II, attributed to (British, 1749-1822). Armchair of carved oak with turned legs and caned seat, with modern green leather squab seat cushion and back panel and brass casters. Replacement back and cushions, Old woodworm holes. Oak frame, cane seat, leather back panel, cushion (replacement), brass (alloy) castors, height, 107.5 cm, width, front, 68 cm, width, back, 57 cm, depth, 64.2 cm, circa 1820 to circa 1821. Regency Period. Production Note: The design is related to three chairs carved from the famous 'Waterloo Elm'. Two were commissioned from Thomas Chippendale by John George Children (1777-1852). The first was given to George IV in 1821 at Carlton House, and is now at Windsor Castle. The second was for Children's own use. It was given by him to the Duke of Wellington in 1837, and now at Apsley House, London. A third armchair was commissioned by the Duke of Rutland, and is at Belvoir Castle. The Fitzwilliam's chair is close in design to the chair at Apsley House."]
