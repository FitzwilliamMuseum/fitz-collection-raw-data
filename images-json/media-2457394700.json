          ["Inscription surrounded by floral border: Honeysuckle. Inscription surrounded by floral border: Snowdrop. Bicknell, Clarence (British, 1842-1918). Recto; watercolour; I plucked a honeysuckle where / The hedge on high is quick with thorn, / And climbing for the prize, was torn, / And foulded my feet in quag-water; / And by the thorns and by the wind / The blossom that I took was thinned, / And yet I found it sweet and fair. / Thence to a richer growth I came, /Where, nursed in mellow intercourse, / The honeysuckles sprang by scores, / Not harried like my sinle stem, / All virgin lamps of scent and dew. / So from my hand that first I threw, / Yet plucked not any more of them. / D.G. Rossetti. Verso; watercolour; Many, many welcomes / February fair-maid, / Ever as of old time, / Solitary firstling. / Coming in the cold time, / Prophet of the gay time, / Prophet of the May time, / Prophet of the roses, / Many, many welcomes / February fair-maid! / Tennyson / Sad-hearted, be at peace! the snowdrop lies / Buried in sepulchre of ghastly snow, / But Spring is floating up the southern skies, / And darkling, the pale snowdrop waits below. / G. MacDonald. Watercolour over graphite on paper, height, leaf, 326  mm, width, leaf, 255 mm, 1908. Part of: A Posy. Vellum-bound sketchbook containing leaves with an index at the end. Cover with brown leather ornamentation and remains of vellum closure straps."]
