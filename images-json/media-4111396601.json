          ["Vase, one of a pair. Meissen Porcelain Factory, production, Germany, Saxony, Meissen. Höroldt, Johann Gregor,  in the style of (German, 1696-1775). C.5A-1963: Beaker shaped hard paste porcelain vase, with a yellow ground and two reserved panels, surrounded by a frame of flowers and leaves. Each panel is painted with a 'chinoiserie' scene, in the style of J. G. Herold. One of a pair. The vase stands on a circular foot. The lower part of its sides curve outwards for a short distance, and then contract a little before expanding towards the wide everted rim. The curved lower part has a white ground decorated on each side with an arrangement of flowers and foliage. The upper part has a bright yellow ground, with on each side a Chinoiserie scene in an oval reserve framed by two sprays of flowers and leaves curving upwards on either side from a central point at the bottom of the reserve.. One reserve is decorated with a little boy, a man (or perhaps woman) holding a fixed fan bedecked with red ribbons, and standing beside a large pot and a plant. To their right is a Chinaman man facing towards them, holding a spoon in his left handl. Overhead there are three fanciful birds and three insects. The second reserve is decorated with a man holding a parasol standing beside a woman who holds a fan in her right hand and with her left points towards a young boy who approaches holding a box. Overhead there are four insects and one fanciful bird. Round the junction of the foot and lower body there is a broad gold band. Hard-paste porcelain, glazed, and decorated with bright yellow ground colour, painting in bluish-grey, pale turquoise, green, red, purple and black enamels, and gilding. Height, whole, 22.4, cm, width, whole, 16.8, cm, width, base, 8, cm, circa 1735 to 1745, possibly later. Chinoiserie. Höroldtmalerei."]
